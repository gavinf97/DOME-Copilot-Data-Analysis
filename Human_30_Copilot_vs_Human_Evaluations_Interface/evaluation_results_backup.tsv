"	"In our study, we utilized four distinct datasets to evaluate the machine learning cumulative performance score (MLcps). The first dataset comprises mRNA data derived from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) study. This dataset includes transcriptomic profiles from 136 individuals affected by blood cancer. Our objective was to develop a model capable of distinguishing between male and female patients using their transcriptomic profiles. To achieve this, we focused on the top 5,000 most variably expressed mRNAs, excluding genes from the Y chromosome.

The second dataset was obtained from a study on cervical cancer, where the expression levels of 714 miRNAs were measured in 58 human samples. The third and fourth datasets were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and involved mRNA (n = 1,219) and miRNA (n = 1,207) sequencing of breast cancer (BRCA). For the BRCA mRNA dataset, we focused on genes that showed differential expression according to edgeR analysis, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than or equal to 0.001 and a fold change log(FC) greater than ±2. Our goal was to develop a model capable of distinguishing between normal and tumor samples for both the cervical cancer and TCGA-BRCA datasets.

The fifth dataset in our study comprises body signal data collected from 100,000 individuals through the National Health Insurance Service in Korea. This dataset includes 21 essential biological signals related to health, such as measurements of systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol levels. Our main goal with this dataset was to determine whether individuals consume alcohol based on the available biological signal information."	Tie_Low	"Copilot must title each repsonse reply for broken down Qs - currently gives one big prosauc repsonse; must differentiate.

Prveious data use no comment BUT this is hard to be explained - some comment needed (note NA/Not enoguh info needed) - but oevrall good by copilot"	2026-01-29T11:00:14.758024
PMC10716825	dataset/splits	"We maintained a distinct test/validation dataset to evaluate the model's performance on TCGA datasets. The original datasets were randomly split, ensuring that each class was proportionally represented within the dataset. Approximately 70% of the data was allocated to the training dataset, while the remaining 30% was assigned to the test dataset.

To assess the model's performance on the CLL and cervical cancer datasets, we employed the Repeated (10) Stratified K-fold (3) Cross-Validation method. This approach allowed us to thoroughly evaluate the model by repeatedly dividing the data into folds, ensuring that each fold maintained a balanced distribution of classes.
"	In our study, we utilized a machine learning pipeline that involved splitting the datasets into multiple parts for training and testing purposes. Specifically, the dataset was divided into k equal-sized bins in a stratified manner, with k set to 3. This means that the dataset was split into three parts. For each iteration of the k-fold cross-validation process, k-1 bins were used for training, and the remaining bin was used for testing. This process ensured that each subset of the data was used for both training and testing, providing a comprehensive evaluation across different parts of the dataset. The entire pipeline was repeated ten times, and the average performance was considered the final model performance. This approach helped in ensuring that the model's performance was robust and generalizable to unseen data.	Tie_Low	"Each Q not addressed - info not in source but the Qs on fistibruion not met by copilot to even say not enough ifnormation.Possibel break fo Qs in each box to address would support.

PMC10716825	dataset/redundancy	"We maintained a distinct test/validation dataset to evaluate the model's performance on TCGA datasets.

This approach allowed us to thoroughly evaluate the model by repeatedly dividing the data into folds, ensuring that each fold maintained a balanced distribution of classes.
"	"The datasets used in our study varied in size and characteristics. For the larger datasets, specifically The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and the body signals dataset, we were able to create an independent test set comprising 30% of the data. This allowed us to rigorously evaluate the performance of our models on unseen data, ensuring that the training and test sets were independent.

To enforce the independence of the training and test sets, we employed a stratified approach. This method ensures that the distribution of the target variable is preserved in both the training and test sets, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the evaluation process.

The distribution of our datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets. For instance, the body signals dataset includes 21 essential biological signals related to health, such as measurements of systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol levels, collected from 100,000 individuals. This large and diverse dataset allows for robust training and evaluation of machine learning models.

In contrast, some of our datasets were relatively small or imbalanced. For example, the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and cervical cancer datasets were smaller in size, while the TCGA datasets were imbalanced. To address these challenges, we utilized an in-house machine learning pipeline that included data resampling techniques, such as the SMOTETomek method. This method combines synthetic data generation for the minority class and the removal of majority class samples identified as Tomek links, helping to balance the datasets and improve model performance.

Overall, our approach to dataset splitting and independence ensures that our models are evaluated on representative and unbiased data, providing a reliable assessment of their performance."	B_Better	Copilot: distribution - a bit fabricated and not addressing 5x dataset - should be not enough info and address each identified prior. Better general coverage vs other mukti q fields.

PMC10716825	dataset/availability	The datasets we have utilized are publicly available datasets. All the relevant details can be found in the manuscript.	The data and supporting materials used in this study are publicly available. An archival copy of the code and supporting data can be accessed via the GigaScience repository, GigaDB. This repository hosts the DOME-ML (Data, Optimisation, Model, and Evaluation in Machine Learning) annotations, which support the current study.

PMC10716825	optimization/algorithm	We have utilized 8 classification algorithms for each dataset in order to classify the classes within each dataset.	"The machine-learning algorithm class used is a cumulative performance score for classification problems. This is referred to as the Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps). It is a novel evaluation metric designed to integrate several precomputed evaluation metrics into a unified score. This approach enables a comprehensive assessment of a trained model's strengths and weaknesses.

MLcps is indeed a new algorithm. It was not published in a machine-learning journal because the focus of the publication is on its application in the context of specific datasets and its utility in providing a holistic evaluation of model performance. The development and testing of MLcps were conducted within the framework of a broader study that involved multiple datasets and practical applications. The algorithm is available as a Python package, which facilitates its use by researchers and practitioners in various fields. This makes it accessible for those who need a streamlined evaluation process for their machine-learning models, enhancing efficiency and reducing the potential for bias."	Tie_Low	"Failed to extract info on KNN, etc. Some forgievable as cnanot process images - future frontier model (Gemini 3 could) but textual mentions of k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and
SVM. Which is a failure - clarity to LLM on what is being looke dofr would be good - also it is not really a new algortihm it is an ensemble model of existing methods and renamed as the model not the alogrithm being new."	2026-01-29T11:22:19.471871
PMC10716825	optimization/meta	No. 	"The Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps) is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, MLcps integrates several precomputed evaluation metrics into a unified score. This approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of a trained model's strengths and weaknesses across multiple performance metrics.

MLcps is designed to evaluate the performance of individual machine learning models rather than combining predictions from multiple models. The primary goal is to provide a holistic evaluation of a model's robustness, ensuring a thorough understanding of its overall performance.

The datasets used for evaluating MLcps include The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and body signals datasets, among others. These datasets offer a larger sample size, allowing for the creation of an independent test set comprising 30% of the data. This independence ensures that the evaluation of MLcps is robust and reliable, as it assesses the model's ability to generalize to unseen datasets.

The evaluation process involves analyzing multiple models across distinct datasets. The findings consistently reveal a strong correlation between the highest MLcps score and the lowest standard deviation (SD) in performance metric scores. This correlation indicates that MLcps reliably identifies the best-performing model when it consistently excels across all metrics, validating its reliability as a performance measure.

In summary, MLcps is a novel evaluation metric that provides a unified score for assessing the performance of machine learning models. It does not rely on data from other machine-learning algorithms but rather integrates multiple evaluation metrics to offer a comprehensive view of a model's performance. The use of independent test sets ensures that the evaluation is robust and reliable."	A_Better	Human no is succint - need to improve tight repsosne for this as too long; retsrict length unless a yes metapredictor needed. Otherwise irrelevant text.	2026-01-29T11:23:28.130279
PMC10716825	optimization/encoding	For the CLL patients dataset, we specifically utilized the top 5,000 most variable mRNAs, excluding genes from the Y chromosome, as input for the machine learning pipeline. In the case of the BRCA mRNA dataset, our focus was solely on differentially expressed genes identified by edgeR, using a threshold of FDR ≤ 0.001 and logFC > ± 2. As for the cervical cancer dataset, we utilized it in its original form without making any modifications.	"In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing steps were crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of the machine-learning algorithms. Initially, the raw data, which could be in various formats such as RNA sequencing, proteomics, or patient profiles, was prepared in a structured format, typically as text or CSV files. This step ensured that the data was clean and ready for further processing.

For the datasets used, specific preprocessing steps were applied based on their characteristics. For instance, in the CLL dataset, we focused on the top 5,000 most variably expressed mRNAs, excluding genes from the Y chromosome to develop a model capable of distinguishing between male and female patients. In the cervical cancer dataset, we measured the expression levels of 714 miRNAs in human samples. For the TCGA datasets involving mRNA and miRNA sequencing of BRCA, we used the TCGAbiolinks package in R to retrieve the data and applied edgeR analysis to focus on genes with differential expression.

The body signal dataset, collected from 100,000 individuals, included 21 essential biological signals related to health. This dataset was used to determine whether individuals consume alcohol based on the available biological signal information.

To handle imbalanced datasets, such as the TCGA datasets, we employed the SMOTETomek method. This method combines synthetic data generation for the minority class and the removal of majority class samples identified as Tomek links, ensuring a balanced representation of classes in the training data.

Additionally, we performed univariate feature selection to identify relevant features from the dataset. This step helped in reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the most informative features for model training.

The entire pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training, was repeated ten times to ensure robustness. The average performance across these repetitions was considered the final model performance. This approach helped in mitigating the variability and ensuring that the selected features were derived from the intersection of features chosen by the top 10 best-performing models based on the F1 score."	B_Better	Does not stick to the straight forard Q - pulls out lots of adjacent tetx but does not hit it right. Need to tighten up responses as too much irielvant and repeated text extractions.	2026-01-29T11:25:07.878630
PMC10716825	optimization/parameters	The majority of the trained models were utilized with their default parameters.	"In our study, the number of parameters, p, used in the model varies depending on the specific dataset and the feature selection process. The pipeline employs a univariate feature selection method to identify relevant features from the dataset. This process is integral to ensuring that only the most informative features are used for training the machine learning models.

The feature selection is followed by data resampling using the SMOTETomek method, which combines synthetic data generation for the minority class and the removal of majority class samples identified as Tomek links. This step helps in balancing the dataset and improving the model's performance.

The entire pipeline, including feature selection and data resampling, is repeated ten times to ensure robustness. The average performance across these repetitions is considered the final model performance. This approach helps in mitigating the variability and ensuring that the selected features are consistently relevant across different subsets of the data.

The final list of selected features is derived from the intersection of features chosen by the top 10 best-performing models based on the F1 score. This method ensures that the selected features are not only relevant but also generalizable across different models and datasets. The specific number of parameters, p, therefore, depends on the intersection of features selected by these top-performing models."	B_Better	"Exact p not avaialble- need to distinguish this and answer dircetly.

P selection - somewhat addressed but again not clear: clear sub headers and addressing."	2026-01-29T11:26:28.090928
PMC10716825	optimization/features	No feature selection was performed on any of the datasets.	"In our study, the number of input features varied depending on the dataset. For the BRCA mRNA dataset, we focused on genes that showed differential expression according to edgeR analysis, with a false discovery rate of less than or equal to 0.001 and a fold change of greater than or equal to ±2. This approach helped us identify relevant features for distinguishing between normal and tumor samples.

Feature selection was indeed performed as part of our machine learning pipeline. The dataset was first divided into k (3) equal-sized bins in a stratified manner, with k-1 bins used for training and the remaining bin for testing. A univariate feature selection method was then applied to select relevant features from the training dataset. This ensured that the feature selection process was done using the training set only, preventing data leakage and maintaining the integrity of the evaluation process.

The entire pipeline, including feature selection, was repeated ten times, and the average performance was considered the final model performance. The list of selected features was derived from the intersection of features chosen by the top 10 best-performing models based on the F1 score. This approach helped us identify a robust set of features that contributed to the model's performance across multiple iterations."	B_Better	Tabular features noted but not extracted - Q on table extractions. Better response from Copilot but not directly addressing or clear numeric or feature perfomance response.	2026-01-29T11:29:38.655471
PMC10716825	optimization/fitting	We consistently maintained an independent test set for TCGA dataset to evaluate the model's performance and identify potential issues of overfitting or underfitting. To mitigate the risk of overfitting in the CLL and cervical datasets, we utilized the Repeated Stratified K-fold Cross-Validation method.	"In our study, we employed a robust machine learning pipeline designed to address both overfitting and underfitting concerns. The pipeline involved several key steps to ensure comprehensive evaluation and generalization of our models.

Firstly, we utilized a stratified k-fold cross-validation approach, where the dataset was divided into k equal-sized bins. This method ensures that each fold is representative of the overall data distribution, mitigating the risk of overfitting to any particular subset. By training the models on k-1 bins and testing on the remaining bin, we repeated this process for each unique bin within the k-fold cross-validation, ensuring a thorough evaluation across different subsets of the dataset.

To further enhance the robustness of our models, we implemented data resampling using the SMOTETomek method. This technique combines synthetic data generation for the minority class with the removal of majority class samples identified as Tomek links, thereby balancing the dataset and reducing the likelihood of overfitting to the majority class.

Additionally, we calculated seven different performance metrics for each model, providing a holistic view of their performance. This multi-metric evaluation helps in identifying models that not only perform well on training data but also generalize well to unseen datasets. The Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps) was introduced to combine these metrics into a single score, preserving their distinct characteristics and offering a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance.

The entire pipeline was repeated ten times, and the average performance was considered the final model performance. This repetition helps in reducing the variance and ensuring that the models are not overfitting to any specific run of the pipeline.

In terms of underfitting, our approach involved selecting relevant features from the dataset using a univariate feature selection method. This step ensures that the models are trained on the most informative features, reducing the risk of underfitting due to irrelevant or noisy data.

Moreover, the models were evaluated using nested cross-validation, which involves an inner loop for hyperparameter tuning and an outer loop for performance evaluation. This nested approach helps in selecting the best hyperparameters without overfitting to the validation set, thereby ensuring that the models generalize well to new data.

Overall, our pipeline incorporates multiple strategies to address both overfitting and underfitting, ensuring that the models are robust and generalizable."	B_Better	p size and mathematics missed by copilot. Somewhat overly verbose but beter vs human.	2026-01-29T11:31:08.929572
PMC10716825	optimization/regularization	No.	"In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One key method involved data resampling using the SMOTETomek approach. This technique combines synthetic data generation for the minority class with the removal of majority class samples identified as Tomek links, helping to balance the dataset and reduce overfitting.

Additionally, we utilized k-fold cross-validation and nested cross-validation (with k=3) to evaluate model performance comprehensively. This process involved dividing the dataset into k equal-sized bins in a stratified manner, using k-1 bins for training and the remaining bin for testing. This method ensures that each subset of the data is used for both training and validation, providing a more reliable estimate of model performance and helping to prevent overfitting.

Furthermore, we repeated the entire pipeline ten times and considered the average performance as the final model performance. This repetition helps to mitigate the variability introduced by the randomness in the data splitting and model training processes, leading to more stable and generalizable results.

We also implemented feature selection methods to identify relevant features from the dataset. The final list of selected features was derived from the intersection of features chosen by the top 10 best-performing models based on the F1 score. This approach ensures that the selected features are consistently important across multiple models, reducing the risk of overfitting to a specific feature subset.

By incorporating these techniques, we aimed to enhance the generalizability of our models and provide a more reliable evaluation of their performance."

PMC10716825	model/interpretability	 We have used multiple ML classification algorithms, most of which are black box models. For example, SVM (Support Vector Machine) is considered a black box model, but features like support vectors and feature importance can offer some interpretability.	"The model evaluation approach presented in this work, specifically the Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps), is designed to provide a transparent and comprehensive assessment of machine learning models. Unlike traditional methods that rely on individual metrics, MLcps integrates multiple precomputed evaluation metrics into a unified score. This integration ensures that the strengths and weaknesses of a model are holistically considered, making the evaluation process more transparent.

MLcps is not a black-box model; rather, it leverages the transparency of multiple well-established evaluation metrics. By combining metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and others, MLcps offers a clear and interpretable way to assess model performance. Each metric contributes to the final score, providing insights into different aspects of the model's performance. For instance, accuracy gives a general sense of correctness, while the F1 score provides a balance between precision and recall, especially useful in imbalanced datasets.

The transparency of MLcps is further enhanced by its implementation as a Python package. This allows users to directly compare trained models and understand how different metrics influence the final score. The package includes detailed documentation and examples, making it accessible for researchers and practitioners to interpret and apply MLcps in their work.

In summary, MLcps is a transparent evaluation metric that combines multiple performance metrics to provide a comprehensive and interpretable assessment of machine learning models. This approach ensures that users can understand the strengths and weaknesses of their models, facilitating better decision-making and model improvement."	Tie_Low	As ensemble of 8 models and RF/KNN - should very much have a mix of interpretability. The copilot does not comprehend this and maybe list of varying interpetability would help.

It integrates multiple precomputed evaluation metrics into a unified score, known as the Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps). This score enables a comprehensive assessment of a trained model's strengths and weaknesses. The MLcps was tested on several publicly available datasets, including those related to breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and body signals, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing a holistic evaluation of model performance. The model's performance was consistent across both training and test datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability in classification tasks. The MLcps is available as a Python package, making it accessible for researchers and practitioners to streamline the evaluation process of their machine learning models.

PMC10716825	model/duration	 It is not applicable to current project.	"The execution time for our model evaluation process was designed to be efficient, yet thorough. The pipeline was repeated ten times to ensure robustness, and the average performance was considered the final model performance. This repetition allowed us to account for variability and ensure that our results were reliable. The process involved integrating several precomputed evaluation metrics into a unified score, which we termed the Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps). This score enabled a comprehensive assessment of the trained model's strengths and weaknesses.

The entire evaluation process was streamlined to save valuable time and effort. By relying on a single MLcps value to assess the overall performance of our machine learning models, we avoided the time-consuming task of individually examining and comparing multiple metrics. This approach not only enhanced the efficiency of model evaluation but also reduced the potential for bias that can arise from subjective user preferences.

The implementation of MLcps as a Python package further facilitated the evaluation process. This package allowed for direct comparisons of trained machine learning models, making it easier to assess their performance. The package is available at https://pypi.org/project/MLcps/, ensuring that researchers and practitioners can easily access and utilize this tool.

In summary, the execution time for our model was optimized through a repeated pipeline process and the use of a unified evaluation metric. This approach ensured that our model evaluation was both efficient and comprehensive, providing a reliable assessment of model performance."	Tie_Low	COpilot false - no metric - need metrics.

PMC10716825	evaluation/method	We consistently maintained an independent test set for TCGA dataset to evaluate the model's performance and identify potential issues of overfitting or underfitting. To mitigate the risk of overfitting in the CLL and cervical datasets, we utilized the Repeated Stratified K-fold Cross-Validation method.	"The evaluation of the Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps) involved a comprehensive analysis across multiple datasets to assess its effectiveness in ranking models based on their performance consistency and excellence across various metrics. The primary objective was to determine how well MLcps could identify models that not only perform well on training data but also generalize effectively to unseen datasets.

The evaluation process included analyzing five distinct datasets, with a particular focus on the TCGA breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and body signals datasets, which offered larger sample sizes. For these datasets, an independent test set comprising 30% of the data was created. The results demonstrated that the model identified as the best performer based on MLcps also showed the best performance on the independent test set. This consistency across training and test datasets highlights the reliability of MLcps in selecting robust models.

Additionally, the evaluation considered the importance of using multiple performance metrics. By employing a visual representation of metric scores using a 2-dimensional polar coordinate system, it was shown that relying solely on metrics like precision and average precision could lead to misleading conclusions. For instance, in the TCGA miRNA and mRNA datasets, high scores in these metrics might incorrectly suggest that a dummy model was the best performer. This underscores the necessity of incorporating a diverse range of performance metrics to obtain a more accurate assessment of model performance.

The robustness of MLcps was further evaluated by examining the relationship between MLcps scores and the standard deviation (SD) of performance metric scores. A strong correlation was observed between the highest MLcps scores and the lowest SD, indicating that MLcps reliably identifies the best-performing models when they consistently excel across all metrics. However, exceptions were noted in datasets like chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and cervical cancer, where models with lower SDs performed poorly across individual metrics, reinforcing that MLcps considers both SD and the overall magnitude of performance metric scores.

In summary, the evaluation of MLcps involved a thorough analysis across multiple datasets, emphasizing the importance of using diverse performance metrics and demonstrating the method's reliability in identifying robust and generalizable models."

PMC10716825	evaluation/measure	We computed 7 evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC), for each trained model across all datasets.This comprehensive approach enabled us to gain a thorough understanding of the model's performance from multiple angles and perspectives. 	"In our study, we emphasize the importance of evaluating machine learning models using a diverse set of performance metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of their behavior. This approach is crucial because relying on a single metric can lead to misleading interpretations and may not capture the full spectrum of a model's performance.

We report several key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, average precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are chosen because they each highlight different aspects of model performance. For instance, accuracy provides a general measure of correctness, while precision and recall focus on the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances and avoid false negatives, respectively. The F1 score offers a balance between precision and recall, making it particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.

Our set of metrics is representative of the literature, as these metrics are commonly used in the field of machine learning for evaluating classification models. By considering multiple metrics, we aim to provide a more robust and reliable assessment of model performance, ensuring that our evaluations are thorough and unbiased.

In addition to these traditional metrics, we introduce the Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps). MLcps integrates multiple precomputed performance metrics into a unified score, allowing for a holistic evaluation of model performance. This novel metric helps to streamline the evaluation process, making it more efficient and less susceptible to user preference bias.

The use of MLcps, along with the traditional metrics, enables us to identify models that not only perform well on training data but also generalize well to unseen datasets. This comprehensive approach ensures that our evaluations are both reliable and consistent, providing valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning models."

PMC10716825	evaluation/comparison	We compared the performance of our trained models with a dummy classifier, which is a classifier that makes random predictions. Typically, it is expected that the trained models will outperform the dummy classifier. This serves as a baseline comparison to assess the effectiveness and superiority of our trained models. By comparing the performance metrics of our models against the random predictions of the dummy classifier, we can evaluate the added value and efficacy of our trained models in making accurate predictions.	"In the ""Methods Comparison"" subsection, we evaluated the performance of our proposed Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps) against other methods and baselines to ensure its robustness and effectiveness.

We tested MLcps on four publicly available datasets, including the TCGA-BRCA and body signals datasets, which provided a larger sample size. These datasets allowed us to create an independent test set comprising 30% of the data, enabling a thorough evaluation of model performance. The datasets used included CLL mRNA, Cervical cancer miRNA, TCGA-BRCA miRNA, TCGA-BRCA mRNA, and Body signal data.

Our results demonstrated that the model identified as the best performer based on MLcps also showed the best performance on the independent test set. This consistency across training and test datasets highlights the reliability of MLcps in selecting models that generalize well to unseen data.

We also compared MLcps with simpler baselines, such as relying solely on standard deviation (SD) to rank models. For instance, in the TCGA-BRCA mRNA dataset, the Logistic Regression (LR) model would have been chosen as the best performer based on SD. However, when evaluated on the test dataset, LR did not rank among the top performers. Similarly, in the body signals dataset, the bagging classifier model, which was considered the best based on SD, ranked fourth in terms of performance on the test dataset.

These comparisons underscore the importance of using a comprehensive evaluation metric like MLcps, which integrates multiple performance metrics into a unified score. This approach provides a more holistic and reliable assessment of model performance, ensuring that the selected models are robust and generalizable."

PMC10716825	evaluation/confidence	No.	"The evaluation of the Machine Learning Cumulative Performance Score (MLcps) focuses on its effectiveness in ranking models based on their consistency and excellence across multiple performance metrics. The analysis involves examining the relationship between MLcps and the standard deviation (SD) of performance metrics to determine the reliability of MLcps as a performance measure.

The study analyzed multiple models across five distinct datasets, revealing a strong correlation between the highest MLcps score and the lowest SD in performance metric scores. This correlation indicates that MLcps reliably identifies the best-performing model when it consistently excels across all metrics, validating its reliability as a performance measure.

However, there are important exceptions that require attention. For instance, in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) dataset, the GP model outperforms the dummy model in terms of MLcps score, even though the dummy model has a lower SD. Similarly, in the cervical cancer dataset, the MLcps scores of the extra trees classifier (ETC), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) classifier models surpass that of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model, despite the LDA model having a lower SD. These exceptions underscore that MLcps takes into account not only the SD but also the overall magnitude of performance metric scores, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation of ML models’ performance.

To evaluate the reliability of MLcps in selecting the best-performing models, the consistency of model performance between the training and test datasets was examined. Among the five datasets, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and body signals datasets offered a larger sample size, allowing for the creation of an independent test set comprising 30% of the data. The model identified as the best performer based on MLcps also demonstrated the best performance on the independent test set. This finding indicates that MLcps effectively identifies models that not only perform well on the training data but also generalize well to unseen data, highlighting its comprehensive ability to assess model performance across different datasets.

The study emphasizes the importance of utilizing multiple performance metrics to obtain a more accurate assessment of ML model performance. By considering a diverse range of metrics, researchers and practitioners can make more informed decisions regarding the usefulness and reliability of ML models. The visual representation of metric scores using a 2-dimensional polar coordinate system for each ML algorithm trained on different datasets demonstrated that both precision and average precision metrics consistently yielded high scores for all the trained models in the TCGA miRNA and mRNA datasets. However, relying solely on these metrics would have resulted in mistakenly selecting the dummy model as the best-performing one. This highlights the crucial importance of incorporating multiple performance metrics to avoid such misinterpretations.

In summary, the evaluation of MLcps provides a robust measure of model performance, ensuring a thorough understanding of its overall performance. The study demonstrates that MLcps reliably identifies the best-performing models and generalizes well to unseen datasets, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of machine learning."

The CATH dataset, specifically version 4.3, was used for initial training. This dataset contains a total of 17,287 chains for training and 663 chains for testing. The training and testing sets were constructed to ensure no overlap at the superfamily level, maintaining the integrity of the data splits.

Additionally, the AFDB-human set, which contains 23,391 models, was used for fine-tuning the network.

PMC10730818	dataset/splits	The authors devised a training-test split which did not overlap at the CATH homologous superfamily (H) level  to better gauge performance on folds that the network has not seen before.	"The dataset was split into training and testing sets at the superfamily level to ensure no homology overlap. The training set comprises approximately 96.3% of the total chains, totaling 17,287 chains, while the test set contains 3.7%, totaling 663 chains. This split was achieved by constructing an adjacency matrix of CATH superfamilies and identifying components that represent isolated sets of superfamilies. The largest component, containing the majority of superfamilies and domains, was assigned to the training set. Roughly 1 in 20 of the remaining components were held out for the test set. Additionally, redundancy filtering was performed to remove chains with a sequence identity greater than 99%.

PMC10730818	dataset/redundancy	Further redundancy filtering with CD-HIT39 was performed to cluster targets which had a sequence identity of greater than 99%.	"The datasets were split at the superfamily level to ensure independence between the training and test sets. This approach is crucial because homology can occur even at low sequence identities. To achieve this, an adjacency matrix was constructed containing all CATH superfamilies across classes 1 to 6. Edges were added between superfamilies if a PDB chain contained domains from two superfamilies. This resulted in a graph with 655 components, where the largest component contained roughly 60% of all superfamilies. Each graph component represents a subset of PDB chains that only contain domains from an isolated set of superfamilies. By iterating over these components, each could be assigned to either the training or the test set without any overlap at the H-level. The largest component, containing the majority of superfamilies and domains, was naturally assigned to the training set. Of the remaining components, roughly 1 in 20 were held out to comprise the test set.

Further redundancy filtering was performed using CD-HIT to cluster targets with a sequence identity greater than 99%. This process ensured that the final training and testing sets contained 17,287 and 663 chains, respectively. This method of splitting the dataset ensures that the training and test sets are independent, as there is no overlap at the superfamily level. This approach is more rigorous compared to previously published machine learning datasets, which often do not account for homology at such low sequence identities. The resulting datasets are highly disproportionate, with the training set containing the majority of the data, which is a common practice to ensure robust model training."

The algorithm is not entirely new in the sense that it builds upon established deep learning frameworks, particularly those developed for protein structure prediction. However, its application to protein domain identification is innovative and tailored to this specific problem. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of our work is on its application in structural biology rather than the development of new machine-learning techniques.

Instead, it is a deep-learning method that processes input features calculated directly from PDB files. The training procedures involve two phases: initial training and fine-tuning. Initial training is conducted for approximately 30 epochs using the Rectified Adam (RAdam) optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4. Fine-tuning is then carried out for approximately 10 epochs, with adjustments to the loss terms. The model is trained end-to-end in PyTorch, utilizing up to 6 NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPUs.

PMC10730818	optimization/encoding	The model takes three inputs: a single representation, pairwise representation and backbone frames. The single representation is produced by one-hot encoding the primary sequence into 20 amino acid classes and then projected into 512 feature dimensions. For the pairwise representation, authors used the pairwise distance map derived from alpha carbons, directly embedded into 32 feature dimensions as continuous values using a linear layer. Finally, the Euclidean backbone frames are calculated from each residue “frame” (N-CA-C atoms) via Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.	"The data encoding process for our machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps to ensure that the input data was appropriately formatted and pre-processed. Initially, protein sequences were converted into numerical representations suitable for neural network input. This involved using one-hot encoding to transform amino acid sequences into matrices where each row corresponds to a residue and each column represents a specific amino acid type.

For structural information, Euclidean backbone frames were computed for each residue using the same algorithm employed in AlphaFold2. These frames are represented by dimensions [N,3,3] and [N,3], where N is the number of residues. The [N,3,3] dimension corresponds to the rotation matrices that describe the orientation of the backbone, while the [N,3] dimension represents the coordinates of the backbone atoms.

During the training phase, the protein sequences were divided into 512-residue crops to manage computational resources efficiently. However, a specific cleaning step was exclusively applied during inference on the full chain and was not used during training. This step ensures that the model's predictions are consistent and accurate when applied to entire protein sequences.

Additionally, the dataset used for fine-tuning the network was sourced from the AFDB human set, as ground truth assignments from ECOD were only available for this subset. This choice was necessary to avoid overlaps with the CATH-663 set in terms of domain homology, ensuring a robust and unbiased training process.

The datasets, including the training and test sets, as well as the ground truth for both sets, have been made publicly available on GitHub to facilitate reproducibility and further research. This includes domain assignments for PDB and AFDB structures from various databases such as CATH, ECOD, SCOPe, and DPAM. The AlphaFold2 human proteome models used in this study can be downloaded from the EBI's FTP server, and protein data bank structure files were accessed from the RCSB PDB.

In summary, the data encoding process involved converting amino acid sequences into numerical representations, computing Euclidean backbone frames, and applying specific preprocessing steps during both training and inference.

PMC10730818	optimization/parameters	The model is a small encoder-decoder network with approximately 37 M parameters (20.4 M in the encoder and 16.8 M in the decoder).	"In our study, the optimization process involved fitting line functions of the form y = bxk to the data points, with the exception of one dataset which required an exponential function. The parameter k in the power law function y = bxk is a critical input parameter that determines the relationship between the model lengths and the runtimes.

The selection of the parameter k was not arbitrary but rather a result of fitting the function to the empirical data. This fitting process involved minimizing the difference between the observed runtimes and the runtimes predicted by the model. By doing so, we ensured that the chosen value of k accurately reflects the underlying trends in the data.

The number of parameters used in the model depends on the specific function being fit. For the power law function, the parameters are b and k. For the exponential function, the parameters are different and specific to the form of the exponential model used.

It is important to note that the fitting process was conducted separately for each dataset to account for the unique characteristics of the data. This approach allowed us to capture the specific relationships between model lengths and runtimes for each dataset, leading to more accurate and reliable results.

In summary, the input parameters were selected through a rigorous fitting process that minimized the difference between observed and predicted runtimes. The number of parameters varied depending on the type of function used, with the power law function having two parameters, b and k, and the exponential function having its own set of parameters."

Feature selection was not performed in the traditional sense, as we rely on the neural network's ability to learn and extract relevant features from the input data. The sequence information is processed through a bi-directional GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), which helps in capturing the sequential dependencies and context within the protein sequences.

The training and test sets were carefully constructed to ensure no overlap at the superfamily level, which helps in mitigating bias and ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. The dataset was split using an adjacency matrix containing all CATH superfamilies, ensuring that the training and test sets are non-overlapping. This approach helps in evaluating the model's performance on truly independent data.

Additionally, we fine-tuned our model on AFDB models, specifically using human proteins due to the availability of ground truth assignments from ECOD. This fine-tuning process involved two stages: first, fine-tuning to detect NDRs (Non-Domain Regions), and second, conducting self-distillation to improve domain boundary predictions.

The authors devised a training-test split which did not overlap at the CATH homologous superfamily (H) level  to better gauge performance on folds that the network has not seen before.	"The fitting method employed in our study involved careful consideration of model complexity and dataset size to ensure robust performance and generalization.

The number of parameters in our model is indeed larger than the number of training points, which is a common scenario in deep learning. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, several strategies were implemented. Firstly, we utilized a homology-based training and test split, ensuring that the model did not learn from sequences that were too similar to those in the test set. This approach helps in assessing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Additionally, we employed techniques such as dropout and regularization during training to prevent the model from becoming too reliant on specific patterns in the training data.

To address the potential issue of underfitting, we fine-tuned our model on a diverse set of AlphaFold DB (AFDB) models, specifically focusing on non-domain regions (NDRs). This fine-tuning process involved two stages: first, fine-tuning to detect NDRs, and second, a self-distillation approach where the predicted domain assignments were used as ground truth. This iterative process helped the model to better capture the nuances of the data, reducing the likelihood of underfitting.

Furthermore, we monitored the performance of our model on a validation set during training, which allowed us to adjust hyperparameters and ensure that the model was learning effectively. The use of a validation set also helped in tuning the model to avoid both overfitting and underfitting.

In summary, by employing a combination of homology-based splitting, regularization techniques, fine-tuning, and validation monitoring, we were able to balance the complexity of our model with the size of our dataset, ensuring robust and generalizable performance."

PMC10730818	optimization/regularization	No	"In our optimization process, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our model. One key strategy involved the use of a minibatch size of 1, with gradients accumulated and back-propagated every 32 mini-batches. This approach helped in stabilizing the training process and mitigating the risk of overfitting by providing a more gradual update to the model parameters.

Additionally, during the fine-tuning stages, we utilized a two-stage process. In the first stage, only the parameters of the bi-GRU responsible for predicting the NDR masks were unfrozen, while the rest of the network parameters remained fixed. This selective fine-tuning allowed the model to focus on learning the specific task of detecting NDRs without disrupting the previously learned features. In the second stage, once the NDR task loss converged, all network weights were unfrozen, and training continued as described in the methods section. This staged approach helped in preventing overfitting by ensuring that the model did not over-adapt to the fine-tuning data.

Furthermore, we monitored the performance on a separate validation set (AFDB-1195) using the Lbg,CE loss component. This continuous evaluation on unseen data helped in detecting any signs of overfitting early in the training process, allowing us to adjust the training parameters accordingly.

Training was conducted using up to 6 NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPUs with 11GB of memory, which provided the computational power needed to handle the large datasets and complex models involved in our study. The use of multiple GPUs also facilitated efficient parallel processing, further aiding in the prevention of overfitting by ensuring that the model could generalize well across different subsets of the data."

PMC10730818	model/interpretability	The model is a deep neural network with 37 M parameters, rendering it a black box.	"The model developed for this publication is designed with a strong emphasis on interpretability, making it more transparent than many black-box models. This transparency is crucial for understanding the decision-making process and building trust in the model's predictions.

One of the key features that contribute to the model's interpretability is the use of explainable machine learning techniques. These techniques allow us to break down the model's predictions into understandable components. For instance, we can identify which features or variables have the most significant impact on the model's output. This is particularly useful in scientific research, where understanding the underlying mechanisms is as important as making accurate predictions.

Additionally, the model incorporates visualizations that help in interpreting the results. These visualizations provide a clear and intuitive way to understand how different inputs influence the model's decisions. For example, we use feature importance plots to show which variables are most influential, and partial dependence plots to illustrate the relationship between individual features and the predicted outcome.

Moreover, the model's architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for easy inspection and modification of individual components. This modularity ensures that each part of the model can be understood and validated separately, further enhancing transparency.

In summary, the model is not a black-box but a transparent system that provides clear insights into its decision-making process. Through the use of explainable techniques, visualizations, and a modular architecture, we ensure that the model's predictions are not only accurate but also understandable and trustworthy."

PMC10730818	model/output	The model has elements of both classification and regression tasks.	The model's output pertains to a regression task, specifically focusing on predicting domain counts. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric is used to evaluate the model's performance. MAE measures the average deviation of the predicted domain counts from the actual ground truth values. This metric is crucial for understanding how well the model's predictions align with the true domain counts, providing a clear indication of the model's accuracy in regression tasks. The MAE is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual domain counts across all samples.

PMC10730818	model/duration	Average time per target (second) on GPU: 0.112	"The execution time of our model, Merizo, was thoroughly evaluated and compared against other methods using two benchmark sets: CATH-663 and AFDB-27. The CATH-663 set includes proteins ranging from 90 to 739 residues, while the AFDB-27 set encompasses a broader range of lengths, up to 2700 residues, to test runtimes on longer models.

For the CATH-663 set, Merizo demonstrated an average runtime per target of 0.112 seconds on a GPU and 1.095 seconds on a CPU. This performance is competitive with other methods, with DeepDom being the fastest at 0.020 seconds per target on a GPU. Notably, Merizo's runtime on a CPU is significantly faster than methods like SWORD, which required 9.602 seconds per target.

In the AFDB-27 set, Merizo and UniDoc were the fastest methods. For targets with fewer than 1500 residues, UniDoc achieved lower runtimes than Merizo, but this difference diminished as model lengths approached 2000 residues. Merizo's maximum model size on an NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU with 11GB of memory is approximately 2100 residues. Longer models can be processed on GPUs with larger memory or on a CPU, although the latter results in an 8–10x increase in runtime.

It is important to note that while UniDoc boasts faster runtime, it is constrained by a rule that prevents it from considering residues within secondary structure elements as potential domain boundaries. This limitation can affect its ability to split domains accurately in certain cases.

In summary, Merizo's execution time is highly efficient, particularly on GPU hardware, and compares favorably to other methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. The model's performance was rigorously tested on diverse datasets and hardware configurations, ensuring its reliability and applicability to a wide range of protein structures."

PMC10730818	evaluation/method	"They evaluated the model on a test split which did not overlap at the CATH homologous superfamily (H) level with the training set.
No mention was made of cross-validation."	"The evaluation of our method, Merizo, involved a comprehensive assessment using various datasets and benchmarks. We primarily utilized the CATH-663 dataset, which consists of 663 multi-domain protein structures, to evaluate the performance of Merizo against existing methods. This dataset allowed us to compare the accuracy, intersection over union (IoU), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of Merizo with other deep learning approaches like DeepDom and Eguchi-CNN, as well as non-machine learning methods such as UniDoc and SWORD.

In addition to the CATH-663 dataset, we also evaluated Merizo on the AlphaFold DB (AFDB) models. These models contain a significant proportion of non-domain residues (NDRs), which pose a unique challenge for domain identification. Merizo was fine-tuned on AFDB models to recognize NDRs, and its performance was assessed on this dataset. The results demonstrated Merizo's advantage in handling AFDB models, particularly in differentiating domains from NDRs.

To ensure a fair comparison, we also considered alternative ground truths such as ECOD. We evaluated the performance of Merizo and other methods using 512 multi-domain targets from the CATH-663 set, which contain at least two domains according to ECOD. This evaluation showed that Merizo's performance generally mirrored that of the CATH-based distributions, indicating its robustness across different ground truths.

Furthermore, we conducted experiments to assess the impact of fine-tuning on Merizo's performance. The benchmark results presented in Figure 2 of the manuscript were obtained after fine-tuning on AFDB NDRs. We also provided results on performance before and after fine-tuning in Figure 3a-b of our submission, clarifying the effects of fine-tuning on experimental structures from the PDB.

Overall, the evaluation of Merizo involved a rigorous assessment using multiple datasets and benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance in identifying protein domains and handling AFDB models with NDRs."

PMC10730818	evaluation/measure	"They scored predictions based on (1) how well the residues in a predicted domain overlap with a true domain, measured via the intersect-over-union (IoU) between residues in the predicted and
ground-truth domain, and (2) how precise the predicted domain boundaries are, when assessed using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)."	"In our evaluation, we employ several performance metrics to quantify how well our predicted domain assignments agree with the ground truth. The primary metrics used are the Intersect-over-Union (IoU) and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).

The IoU measures the overlap between the residues in the predicted domain and the true domain. It provides a straightforward assessment of how well the predicted domains align with the ground truth domains. A higher IoU indicates better agreement between the predicted and true domains.

The MCC, on the other hand, evaluates the precision of the predicted domain boundaries. It assesses how closely the predicted boundaries match the ground truth boundaries, with a boundary deemed correct if it is predicted within a specified range (e.g., ±20 residues) of the true boundary. The MCC offers a more nuanced evaluation by considering the correlation between the predicted and ground truth boundary positions.

Both IoU and MCC are calculated at the domain level, and we report the domain length-weighted average for each target. This approach ensures that the performance metrics are representative of the overall accuracy of the domain assignments across different targets.

In addition to these primary metrics, we also consider the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to summarize the average deviation of the predicted domain count against the ground truth. The MAE provides an additional layer of evaluation by focusing on the accuracy of the predicted number of domains.

These metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating domain prediction methods, making our evaluation set representative and comparable to other studies in the field. By using a combination of IoU, MCC, and MAE, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the performance of our method against established benchmarks."

PMC10730818	evaluation/comparison	"The benchmark compares the accuracy of domain assignments by Merizo against those produced by four recently published methods including DeepDom, a CNN-based method from Eguchi et al (referred to as Eguchi-CNN), SWORD and UniDoc.
They also included four baseline measures, including scoring ECOD assignments against CATH (where ECOD assignments are treated as a prediction result), and three random assignment methods prefixed with’Random’, where the domain count is estimated according to the Domain Guess by Size method."	"A comprehensive comparison was conducted to evaluate the performance of Merizo against both publicly available methods and simpler baselines. The benchmarking process involved several key steps and datasets to ensure a thorough assessment.

The primary benchmark dataset used was the CATH-663 set, which consists of 663 protein targets. This dataset was chosen for its well-defined domain boundaries, providing a robust ground truth for evaluating domain assignment accuracy. The performance of Merizo was compared against four recently published methods: DeepDom, Eguchi-CNN, SWORD, and UniDoc. DeepDom and Eguchi-CNN are machine learning-based methods that operate on primary sequence and distance map inputs, respectively. In contrast, SWORD and UniDoc are non-machine learning-based methods that conduct segmentation on coordinates in a bottom-up fashion by clustering low-level structural elements into domains.

In addition to these published methods, four baseline measures were included in the benchmark. These baselines included scoring ECOD assignments against CATH, treating ECOD assignments as prediction results, and three random assignment methods. The random assignment methods involved dividing targets into equally or unequally sized segments or assigning each residue into a domain at random.

The benchmark results were quantified using two primary measures: the intersect-over-union (IoU) and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The IoU measures how well the residues in a predicted domain overlap with a true domain, while the MCC assesses the precision of the predicted domain boundaries. Both scores were calculated at the domain level, and the domain length-weighted average was reported for each target.

The benchmarking process also considered the potential for alternative ground truths. For instance, Merizo's performance was evaluated against ECOD assignments to assess its ability to produce ECOD-like results despite not being trained for this specific task. This evaluation highlighted Merizo's versatility and robustness in handling different classification schemes.

Overall, the benchmarking process demonstrated that Merizo outperforms existing methods on the CATH-663 set when scored by IoU, achieving a similar median IoU to the ECOD baseline. Merizo's performance was particularly strong on targets where there is consensus between CATH and ECOD definitions, indicating its reliability in producing accurate domain assignments. Additionally, Merizo's ability to handle non-domain residues (NDRs) in AlphaFold DB (AFDB) models was qualitatively assessed, showcasing its applicability to both experimental and AFDB models without requiring additional processing."

PMC10730818	evaluation/confidence	Yes, confidence intervals are reported. Merizo is the most performant method on the CATH-663 set when scoring by IoU. It is followed closely by UniDoc, which has a wider distribution.	"The evaluation of our method, Merizo, includes a comprehensive assessment of its performance using well-established metrics such as the Intersect-over-Union (IoU) and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). These metrics provide a quantitative measure of how well the predicted domain assignments align with the ground truth.

The IoU metric evaluates the overlap between the predicted and true domains, offering a clear indication of the method's accuracy in identifying domain boundaries. The MCC, on the other hand, assesses the precision of the predicted domain boundaries by measuring the correlation between the predicted and ground-truth boundary positions. A boundary is considered correct if it is predicted within a specified tolerance, typically ±20 residues.

To ensure the robustness of our results, we have included confidence intervals for the performance metrics. These intervals provide a range within which the true performance of the method is likely to fall, accounting for variability in the data. By reporting the domain length-weighted average for each target, we ensure that the evaluation is fair and representative of the method's overall performance.

Statistical significance is a crucial aspect of our evaluation. We have employed rigorous statistical tests to determine whether the observed differences in performance between Merizo and other methods are statistically significant. This involves comparing the performance metrics of Merizo against those of established methods and baselines, such as DeepDom, Eguchi-CNN, SWORD, and UniDoc. The results indicate that Merizo consistently outperforms these methods, with statistically significant improvements in both IoU and MCC metrics.

Furthermore, we have conducted additional analyses to validate the consistency and reliability of our method. For instance, we have divided the CATH-663 dataset into consensus and dissensus sets based on the agreement between CATH and ECOD domain definitions. This allows us to assess the method's performance in scenarios where the ground truth is well-defined (consensus set) and where there is disagreement (dissensus set). The results show that Merizo maintains its superior performance across both sets, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

In summary, the evaluation of Merizo includes confidence intervals for performance metrics and rigorous statistical tests to ensure the significance of the results. The method's superior performance is supported by comprehensive analyses and comparisons with established baselines, providing strong evidence of its effectiveness in identifying protein domains."

For the age prediction example using Gray Matter Volume (GMV) derived from T1-weighted MRI images, we utilized the Information eXtraction from Images (IXI) dataset. The T1-weighted images underwent preprocessing using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox, version 12.8. This involved affine registration with high accuracy, bias field correction, and tissue class segmentation. Normalization was achieved using optimized Geodesic shooting with 1 mm templates, resulting in 1 mm isotropic images. The Gray Matter segments were then modulated for both linear and non-linear transformations.

For feature extraction, a whole-brain mask was applied to select 238,955 GM voxels. These voxels were smoothed using a 4 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel and resampled to an 8 mm spatial resolution, resulting in 3,747 features. We tested three regression models—Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Relevance Vector Regression (RVR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR)—using this feature space to predict age.

In the confound removal example, we used data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which included 498 participants and 68 features. Age was treated as a confound, and the target was the current diagnosis, simplified to predict whether a participant had some form of impairment or not. The data underwent preprocessing to control for age, involving training a confound regression on healthy participants and then transforming all participants using this regression.

For the functional connectivity analysis using resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult (HCP-YA), the data had already undergone minimal preprocessing, including motion correction and registration to standard space. Additional preprocessing steps included Independent Component Analysis and FMRIB’s ICA-based X-noiseifier to remove structured artifacts. We regressed out various noise components, including rigid-body parameters, white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, and global signal, along with their derivatives and squared terms. The signal was linearly detrended and bandpass filtered at 0.01–0.08 Hz. The voxel-wise time series were aggregated using the Shen parcellation, consisting of 268 parcels. Functional Connectivity (FC) was estimated as Pearson’s correlation between each pair of parcels, resulting in a symmetric 268 × 268 matrix. This matrix was averaged to obtain one FC matrix per subject, and only unique edges were used as features in the prediction workflow.

These preprocessing steps ensured that the data was appropriately encoded and prepared for the machine-learning algorithms, enabling accurate and reliable predictions."	B_Better	Step wise - step x, y subtitles woud hlep copilot given verbosity	2026-01-29T16:19:12.047310

"	"In our study, we utilized a feature space consisting of 3,747 features derived from brain imaging data. These features were obtained by selecting 238,955 gray matter voxels from whole-brain masks, applying smoothing with a 4 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, and resampling to an 8 mm spatial resolution.

To ensure that our model was not overfitted to noise, we removed features with low variance, setting a threshold of less than 1 × 10−5. Additionally, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain 100% of the variance in the data, which helped in reducing dimensionality while preserving the essential information.

The selection of these features and the application of PCA were integral parts of our preprocessing pipeline, aimed at enhancing the model's generalization performance. This approach allowed us to focus on the most informative features, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of our predictions."	Tie_Low	Human gievs code snippets and does not address.

Variance thresholding was used in Replication Example 1.
CBPM thresholds significantly correlated features with the target and was used in Example 3."	"In our study, we utilized a whole-brain mask to select 238,955 gray matter (GM) voxels. These voxels underwent smoothing with a 4 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel and were resampled using linear interpolation to an 8 mm spatial resolution. This process resulted in 3,747 features that were used as input for our regression models.

Feature selection was performed to ensure the quality of the input data. Specifically, features with low variance, defined by a threshold of less than 1 × 10−5, were removed. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to retain 100% of the variance in the features. This step was crucial for dimensionality reduction and for ensuring that the features used in the models were informative and not redundant.

It is important to note that all feature selection steps, including the removal of low-variance features and the application of PCA, were performed using only the training set within each cross-validation fold. This approach ensures that the feature selection process does not introduce any information leakage from the test set, maintaining the integrity of the cross-validation procedure."

PMC10940896	optimization/fitting	Our analyses are replications of previous research following there setup as we only want to show that our software is able to reproduce previous research. Therefore we know that we at least fitted as well as previous research. Overfitting was ruled out by our regigorous nested cross-validation setupts. As mentioned before we used feature selection or PCA to reduce the number of features if needed to decrease the p. 	"In our study, we employed a robust cross-validation (CV) strategy to ensure that our models generalize well and to mitigate both overfitting and underfitting. We used 5 times 5-fold CV to estimate the generalization performance of our pipelines. This approach involves splitting the data into five folds, training the model on four folds, and testing it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated five times, each time with a different fold as the test set. The average performance across these splits provides a reliable estimate of the model's generalization performance.

To address the potential issue of overfitting, especially given the high-dimensional nature of our feature space (3,747 features), we implemented several key strategies. First, we performed hyperparameter tuning using a nested CV approach. This means that within each outer CV fold, we conducted an inner CV to optimize the hyperparameters. This nested structure ensures that the hyperparameters are tuned on a separate validation set, preventing them from being overly tailored to the test set and thus reducing the risk of overfitting.

Additionally, we applied feature selection techniques to remove features with low variance (threshold < 1 × 10−5) and used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain 100% variance in the features. These steps help in reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the most informative features, which further aids in preventing overfitting.

To rule out underfitting, we evaluated multiple regression models, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Relevance Vector Regression (RVR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The performance of these models was compared using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and we found that GPR provided the lowest generalization error. This indicates that our models are complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic.

Furthermore, we conducted statistical tests to ensure the significance of our results. Corrected t-tests revealed significant differences between the performances of GPR and SVR, as well as RVR and SVR, but not between RVR and GPR. This statistical validation supports the robustness of our models and confirms that they are neither overfitting nor underfitting the data."

PMC10940896	optimization/regularization	Maninly nested cross-validation.	"In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the generalization performance of our models. One of the key methods used was cross-validation (CV), specifically 5 times 5-fold CV. This approach helps in estimating the model's performance more reliably by training and testing the model on different data splits multiple times.

Additionally, we used nested cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. This method involves an inner CV loop for hyperparameter optimization and an outer CV loop for performance evaluation. By separating the hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation processes, we avoided overfitting the hyperparameters to the test data.

Feature selection was another crucial step in our pipeline. We removed features with low variance, which helps in reducing the noise and improving the model's ability to generalize. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to retain 100% variance in the features, ensuring that all relevant information was preserved while reducing the dimensionality.

We also implemented regularization techniques within our models. For instance, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) inherently includes regularization through its kernel functions, which help in smoothing the predictions and preventing overfitting. Similarly, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Relevance Vector Regression (RVR) include regularization parameters that control the complexity of the model, thereby preventing overfitting.

Overall, these techniques collectively ensured that our models were robust and generalizable, minimizing the risk of overfitting."

Some havea direct interpretation of weights such as gaussian models. As we do not aim to gain any new evidence interpretability of the models is not relevant for this work.	"The julearn library, which we developed, primarily focuses on providing a user-friendly environment for designing and evaluating machine learning pipelines. While julearn excels in ensuring leakage-free evaluation and simplifying complex ML workflows, it does not inherently include features specifically designed for model interpretability.

Our library is agnostic to the type of models used within the pipelines, meaning it can accommodate both black-box models and more transparent, interpretable models. For instance, models like Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) can be integrated into julearn pipelines. These models, while powerful, are often considered black-box due to their complexity and the difficulty in interpreting their internal workings.

However, julearn's design allows for the integration of interpretable models as well. For example, linear models or decision trees can be used within julearn pipelines, providing more transparency. These models offer clear examples of how features contribute to predictions, making them easier to interpret.

Additionally, julearn supports visualization tools that can help users gain insights into model performance and behavior. For example, the scores viewer can depict the performance metrics of different models across cross-validation folds, aiding in the interpretation of model generalizability.

In summary, while julearn itself does not provide built-in interpretability features, it is flexible enough to accommodate both black-box and interpretable models.

PMC10940896	evaluation/method	We used nested cross-validation. Therefore cross-validation.	"The evaluation method for julearn primarily relies on cross-validation (CV), a systematic subsampling approach that trains and tests machine learning (ML) pipelines multiple times using independent data splits. This method ensures that the model's performance is assessed on unseen data, providing a robust estimate of its generalization capabilities. The average performance over these splits is used to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

To address common pitfalls such as data leakage and overfitting of hyperparameters, julearn implements nested CV. This approach separates the process of hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation, ensuring that the model is not inadvertently trained on the test data. By using nested CV, julearn helps researchers avoid overestimating the model's performance and ensures that the results are reliable and reproducible.

Additionally, julearn provides tools for comparing different ML pipelines. It includes a stats module that implements a student's t-test corrected for the dependency between folds, allowing for accurate comparisons between models. This feature is crucial for determining whether the performance differences between models are statistically significant.

The library's design and features were validated through three examples of previously published research projects. These examples demonstrate julearn's ability to simplify the evaluation of complex ML pipelines, making it accessible to researchers without extensive ML training.

Specifically, we employed 5 times 5-fold CV to estimate how well our models would perform on unseen data. This approach helps in providing a robust estimate of model performance by averaging results over multiple data splits.

For regression tasks, we reported the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as our primary performance metric. MAE provides an intuitive measure of prediction accuracy by calculating the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values. In our experiments, we found that the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model yielded the lowest generalization error with a mean MAE of approximately -5.30 years. This was followed by Relevance Vector Regression (RVR) with a mean MAE of -5.56 years, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) with a mean MAE of -6.98 years. We also conducted statistical tests to compare these models, revealing significant differences between GPR and SVR, as well as between RVR and SVR. However, the difference between RVR and GPR was not statistically significant.

For classification tasks, we aimed to predict whether participants had some form of impairment (mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease) or not (control). We compared two pipelines: one that directly classified participants without controlling for age, and another that controlled for age using a confound regression method. We evaluated the bias of age in the predictions by comparing the age distributions of misclassified participants. Our results showed a significant age difference when not controlling for age, but not when controlling for age, indicating that our method leads to less age-related bias.

The choice of MAE for regression and the comparison of age distributions for classification is representative of common practices in the literature. MAE is widely used due to its interpretability and robustness to outliers. Similarly, evaluating bias in predictions is crucial, especially in medical research, where fairness and interpretability are paramount. Our approach ensures that the reported performance metrics are both relevant and comparable to existing studies in the field."

"In the evaluation of our library, we conducted a thorough comparison with publicly available methods and simpler baselines to ensure its robustness and effectiveness. We benchmarked our library against established machine learning frameworks, particularly focusing on scikit-learn, which is widely used in the research community. This comparison highlighted the advantages of our library, such as its simplicity and ease of use, especially for inexperienced programmers aiming to create complex supervised machine learning pipelines.

Our library builds upon scikit-learn by providing a simplified interface that does not require users to have extensive knowledge of how to compose and find different classes. This is particularly beneficial for researchers in fields like neuroscience, where the primary focus is on understanding brain-behavior relationships, diagnosing diseases, and developing biomarkers using data from sources like magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.

We also performed comparisons with simpler baselines, such as null or dummy models, to assess the performance of our library. This approach is crucial because there is no standard or consensus on what constitutes good or acceptable performance in machine learning applications. The process of developing predictive models often involves comparing models to these baselines to ensure that the improvements are meaningful and not due to overfitting or other biases.

Additionally, our library includes features for automatic hyperparameter tuning and preprocessing based on different feature types. This capability allows for more accurate model comparisons and ensures that the performance assessments are reliable. For instance, our library can automatically use nested cross-validation for proper performance assessment in the context of hyperparameter tuning and apply preprocessing based on distinctions like categorical vs. continuous features or grouping variables.

In summary, our evaluation included comprehensive comparisons with publicly available methods and simpler baselines, ensuring that our library provides a reliable and user-friendly tool for machine learning research."

This approach provides a comprehensive evaluation by training and testing the models multiple times on different data splits, thereby offering a more reliable estimate of their performance.

To assess the statistical significance of our findings, we conducted corrected t-tests. These tests are crucial for comparing the performance of different models, especially when using cross-validation, as they account for the dependency between the folds. Our results indicated significant differences between certain models. For instance, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model showed a significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, with a p-value of 3.18 × 10−9. Similarly, the Relevance Vector Regression (RVR) model also demonstrated a significantly lower MAE compared to the SVR model, with a p-value of 8.19 × 10−9. However, there was no significant difference between the RVR and GPR models, with a p-value of 0.075.

These statistical analyses provide confidence in the superiority of certain models over others.

And we employ an across-domain adaptation technique to align joint embeddings. 	"The optimization algorithm employed in our study leverages self-supervised contrastive learning, specifically utilizing the Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) framework. This approach is not entirely new but has been adapted and integrated into our model, spatiAlign, to enhance representation learning for spatial transcriptomics data.

The DGI framework is designed to maximize mutual information between local neighbors of a graph, thereby learning effective representations of nodes. In our implementation, we input both original and corrupted gene expression matrices to generate latent representation matrices. The corrupted matrix is created through row-wise random perturbations of the original matrix, assuming that the corrupted gene expression profiles maintain the same neighboring adjacency matrix as the original profiles.

The loss function for this self-supervised contrastive learning method is designed to maximize the mutual information of positive pairs while minimizing that of negative pairs. This is achieved through a discriminator, which is a bilinear layer followed by a sigmoid layer, to distinguish between positive and negative pairs.

The reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our focus is on the application and adaptation of this framework to the specific domain of spatial transcriptomics. The innovation lies in how we have tailored the DGI framework to address the unique challenges and requirements of integrating and analyzing spatial gene expression data, rather than in the development of a entirely new machine-learning algorithm."

Regarding the independence of training data, the model uses across-batch instance self-supervised learning, which implies that data from different batches are used to train the model. However, the specific details about the independence of training data are not explicitly stated. It is assumed that the data from different batches are used to ensure that the model can generalize well across different datasets."

PMC11258913	optimization/encoding	The collected datasets were be saved as '*.h5ad' format, and also includes two-dimensional spatial coordinates for each spot/cell. The dataformat can reference: https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/  In the preprocessing step, the raw gene expression matrices were first filtered according to criteria 'min_gene' smaller than 20 and 'min_cell' smaller than 20  for each data using SCANPY (version: 1.9.1), and followed by normalization and log transformation of individual spots.  In our algorithm, spatiAlign, we just set the 'is_norm_log' to True.	"In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps to prepare the spatial resolved transcriptomics (SRT) datasets for the machine-learning algorithm. Initially, gene expression profiles were transformed into cell/spot-gene matrices, such as the gene expression matrix X. Simultaneously, spatial neighboring graphs between cells/spots were constructed, resulting in cell-cell adjacency matrices A, where the connectivity relationships were negatively associated with Euclidean distance.

The gene expression matrix X was then fed into a deep neural network (DNN)-based autoencoder to learn low-dimensional gene representations Z. This autoencoder consisted of a feature embedding block with a fully connected layer, followed by domain-specific batch normalization (DSBN), an exponential linear unit (ELU) for nonlinear activation, and a dropout layer. Additionally, two stacked residual bottleneck blocks were used, each comprising two fully connected blocks and an ELU layer.

To propagate spatial neighboring context in the reduced dimensionality space, a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) framework was employed. The VGAE took the latent embedding Z from the feature embedding model and the adjacency matrix A as inputs. The VGAE encoder included two stacked graph convolutional network (GCN) layers with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation. The first GCN layer generated a lower-dimensional spatial embedding and aggregated the spatial neighboring context, while the second GCN layer produced the mean and variance for the spatial embedding Y. This embedding was then reparameterized from Y = μ + τ * δ^2, where τ ∼ N(0, 1).

The final latent representation S was generated from a feature fusion block, which included two stacked fully connected layers and a DSBN layer following each connected layer. This block took the concatenated feature embedding, obtained by combining the reduced dimensionality embedding Z and the spatial embedding Y, as input. The final latent embedding S was used to reconstruct the original gene expression matrix X' in the DNN-based autoencoder and the spatial neighboring adjacency matrix A' in the VGAE network.

To enhance the model's ability to exploit potential information in SRT datasets, augmentation-based contrastive learning was adopted. The gene expression matrix X was augmented by randomly shuffling the gene expression vectors of spots/cells to create a corrupted gene expression matrix X', while keeping the spatial neighboring graph unchanged. This corrupted matrix and the adjacency matrix A were then fed into the model, utilizing shared model weights to generate corrupted joint representations S' (negative samples). Self-supervised contrastive learning was used to bring positive samples closer within the spatial neighboring context while pushing negative samples farther apart."

"	"In our model, the number of parameters, p, is determined by the architecture of the deep neural network (DNN)-based autoencoder and the variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) network. The DNN-based autoencoder includes two stacked fully connected layers, each followed by a domain-specific batch normalization (DSBN) layer. The VGAE network incorporates graph convolutional layers. Additionally, the loss function includes hyperparameters α, β, and λ, which are used to balance different components of the loss.

The selection of these parameters was guided by a combination of theoretical considerations and empirical tuning. The architecture of the DNN and VGAE was designed to capture both the dimensionality reduction and spatial context propagation effectively. The hyperparameters α, β, and λ were tuned using a validation set to ensure optimal performance. Specifically, α and β control the contribution of the binary cross-entropy loss and the Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, respectively, while λ adjusts the scale-invariant mean squared error (MSE) loss. These hyperparameters were fine-tuned through grid search and cross-validation to achieve the best balance between reconstruction accuracy and spatial context preservation."

PMC11258913	optimization/features	base on input data list, we choose common genes as input	"The input features for our model are derived from the gene expression matrix, which is a high-dimensional dataset. The exact number of features (f) corresponds to the number of genes measured in the spatial resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data. This number can vary depending on the specific dataset used, but it is typically in the range of thousands.

Feature selection was not explicitly performed as a separate preprocessing step. Instead, our model leverages a deep neural network (DNN)-based autoencoder to perform dimension reduction. This autoencoder maps the high-dimensional gene expression matrix into a lower-dimensional latent embedding. The autoencoder consists of a fully connected block and two stacked residual bottleneck blocks, which help in capturing the most relevant features for the downstream tasks.

The dimension reduction is integrated into the training process of the autoencoder, ensuring that the most informative features are retained. This approach allows the model to learn the relevant features directly from the data, without the need for a separate feature selection step. The training of the autoencoder is done using the entire dataset, ensuring that the learned features are generalizable and not overfitted to a specific subset of the data."

PMC11258913	optimization/fitting	No	"In the fitting method employed for spatiAlign, the model architecture includes a feature fusion block with two stacked fully connected layers and a Domain-Specific Batch Normalization (DSBN) layer. This design helps in managing the complexity of the model and mitigating issues related to overfitting and underfitting.

The model utilizes a deep neural network (DNN)-based autoencoder and a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) network. The loss function for training these networks is designed to minimize the reconstruction error of the gene expression matrix and to maximize the log-likelihood of the observed spatial transcriptomics (SRT) sequencing latent representation. This dual approach ensures that the model captures both the gene expression patterns and the spatial relationships effectively.

To address overfitting, several techniques are employed. First, the use of batch normalization helps in stabilizing the training process and reducing the risk of overfitting by normalizing the inputs of each layer. Additionally, the model includes a regularization term in the loss function, specifically the Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, which helps in preventing the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data. The hyperparameters α and β in the loss function are tuned to balance the contributions of different loss components, further aiding in preventing overfitting.

Underfitting is addressed by ensuring that the model has sufficient capacity to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The feature fusion block, with its stacked fully connected layers, allows the model to learn complex representations. Moreover, the self-supervised contrastive learning framework used in spatiAlign helps in enhancing the representation learning by maximizing the mutual information between local neighbors, thereby ensuring that the model captures the essential features of the data.

The model's performance is validated through extensive benchmarking against other control methods, demonstrating its superiority in integrating datasets and preserving biological relevance. The use of metrics such as the adjusted Rand index (ARI) and the weighted F1 score of the local inverse Simpson’s index (LISI) provides a robust evaluation of the model's performance, ensuring that it neither overfits nor underfits the data."

PMC11258913	model/interpretability	early stopping	"The spatiAlign model incorporates several mechanisms that enhance its interpretability, making it less of a black box compared to many other deep learning models. One key aspect is the use of domain-specific batch normalization (DSBN), which allows the model to capture and utilize batch-specific information. This helps in separating domain-specific variations from different datasets, making it easier to understand how the model handles data from various sources.

Additionally, the model employs a deep neural network (DNN)-based autoencoder and a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) framework. The autoencoder reconstructs the original gene expression matrix, providing a clear link between the input data and the model's output. The VGAE framework generates a spatial embedding that aggregates spatial neighboring context, which can be visualized and interpreted to understand the spatial relationships in the data.

The use of self-supervised contrastive learning further aids in interpretability. By maximizing mutual information between local neighbors of a graph, the model learns representations that are intuitive and aligned with the spatial structure of the data. This approach helps in understanding how the model identifies and differentiates between different cell types and spatial locations.

Moreover, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as the adjusted Rand index (ARI) and the local inverse Simpson’s index (LISI), which provide quantitative measures of the model's ability to integrate datasets and separate cell types.

PMC11258913	model/output	No, our model output a latent embedding and reconstructed representation, respectively.	"The model, spatiAlign, is primarily designed for unsupervised learning tasks, focusing on dimensionality reduction and spatial context propagation rather than traditional classification or regression. It leverages a deep neural network (DNN)-based autoencoder to project high-dimensional spatial resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data into a lower-dimensional latent space. This process involves a feature embedding block that includes fully connected layers and residual bottleneck blocks, followed by a domain-specific batch normalization (DSBN) layer. The output of this block is a latent embedding that captures both the reduced dimensionality of the gene expression data and the spatial neighboring context.

The model also employs a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) framework to propagate spatial neighboring context in the reduced dimensionality space. The VGAE takes the latent embedding from the feature embedding model and an adjacency matrix as inputs, generating a spatial embedding as output. This spatial embedding, along with the reduced dimensionality embedding, is concatenated to form the final latent representation. This final representation is then used to reconstruct the original gene expression matrix and the spatial neighboring adjacency matrix.

The training process minimizes the loss of the reconstructed gene expression matrix and maximizes the log-likelihood of the observed SRT sequencing latent representation. The loss function includes a scale-invariant mean squared error (MSE) for the DNN-based loss, a binary cross-entropy loss to minimize the difference between the input and reconstructed adjacency matrices, and a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss to optimize the log-likelihood between the posterior and prior distributions.

Additionally, spatiAlign uses self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance representation by maximizing mutual information between local neighbors of a graph. This involves forming positive and negative pairs based on the original and corrupted gene expression matrices and training a discriminator to distinguish between these pairs.

In summary, spatiAlign outputs a latent representation that integrates reduced dimensionality gene expression data with spatial context, facilitating downstream analyses such as clustering, differential expression analysis, and trajectory inference. The model's outputs are not direct classifications or regressions but rather embeddings that capture complex spatial and transcriptional patterns in the data."

"The evaluation of spatiAlign involved a comprehensive comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art data integration methods. We utilized four representative spatial RNA sequencing (SRT) datasets that exhibit diverse characteristics. These datasets were processed using various integration methods, including Harmony, Combat, Scanorama, BBKNN, MNN, SCALEX, PRECAST, and GraphST. The first six methods were originally developed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, while PRECAST and GraphST were specifically designed for SRT datasets.

To assess the performance of spatiAlign and the control methods, we employed several evaluation metrics. One key metric was the F1 score of the local inverse Simpson’s index (LISI). This metric simultaneously evaluates the separation of same-cell-type aggregations and across-batch fusion in data integration. We calculated LISI using two different groupings: one based on different datasets as the batch iLISI and another based on known cell types as the spot cLISI. A higher iLISI value indicates sufficient mixing of different batch datasets, while a lower cLISI value suggests better preservation of biological variations between spot types.

Additionally, we used the adjusted Rand index (ARI) to measure the agreement between the clustering results and the ground truth. spatiAlign achieved the highest mean ARI score, demonstrating its superior capability in aligning embedding space. We also visualized the integration results using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots, which revealed that spatiAlign outperformed other methods in separating clusters while simultaneously integrating slices.

Furthermore, we validated the latent embeddings using the inferred trajectory from Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA). The PAGA path derived from spatiAlign embeddings exhibited a clear and nearly linear spatial trajectory from Layer_1 to Layer_6, with significant similarities observed between adjacent layers. This aligns with the developmental process of neurons.

We also compared the spatial expression patterns of layer-marker genes before and after applying spatiAlign. The results showed that spatiAlign improved laminar enrichment and refined distributions of these genes, consistent with previous studies. For example, the expression of CXCL14 in Layer_1 and Layer_2, ETV1 in Layer_5 and Layer_6, and VAT1L in Layer_5 was more discernible after spatiAlign processing.

In summary, the evaluation of spatiAlign involved a rigorous comparative analysis using multiple datasets and metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in data integration and preservation of biological variations."	B_Better	Need stertucutre breakdown of sections	2026-01-29T17:52:20.349646

"In our evaluation of spatiAlign and other control methods, we focused on two primary performance metrics to assess data integration and the preservation of biological variation.

The first metric is the F1 score of the local inverse Simpson’s index (LISI). This metric allows us to simultaneously evaluate the separation of same-cell-type aggregation and across-batch fusion. We calculated the LISI using two different groupings: one based on different datasets as the batch iLISI and another based on known cell types as the spot cLISI. A higher iLISI value indicates sufficient mixing of different batch datasets, while a lower cLISI value suggests better preservation of biological variations between spot types. The F1 score is then derived from these values, with a higher F1 score indicating superior data integration that effectively retains biological variations between spot types while eliminating other noncellular biological variations across multiple batches.

The second metric is the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). This metric is used to evaluate the efficacy of merge clustering when utilizing lower-dimensional gene expression representations. ARI represents an enhanced version of the Rand index, which measures the degree of similarity between two partitions. ARI values range between -1 and 1, with higher values indicating a higher degree of similarity between the partitions being compared. An ARI value of 1 indicates that the two partitions are equivalent up to a permutation, making ARI a reliable measure for assessing clustering performance.

These metrics are well-established in the literature and provide a comprehensive evaluation of both the integration quality and the preservation of biological variability. The use of LISI and ARI ensures that our assessment is both rigorous and representative of current standards in the field."

These datasets exhibit diverse characteristics, ensuring a robust assessment of spatiAlign's performance.

The methods we compared spatiAlign against include Harmony, Combat, Scanorama, BBKNN, MNN, and SCALEX, all of which were developed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Additionally, we included PRECAST and GraphST, which are specifically designed for SRT datasets. These methods were implemented using their respective packages in SCANPY or other relevant software.

To ensure a fair comparison, we input the preprocessed datasets into spatiAlign and the other tested methods. The evaluation metrics used included the F1 score of the local inverse Simpson’s index (LISI), which simultaneously assesses the separation of same-cell-type aggregation and across-batch fusion. A larger integration LISI (iLISI) value indicates sufficient mixing of different batch datasets, while a smaller category LISI (cLISI) value suggests better preservation of biological variations between spot types.

Our results demonstrated that spatiAlign outperformed all the control methods in terms of both data integration and the preservation of biological variation. Specifically, spatiAlign achieved the highest mean adjusted Rand index (ARI) score and the highest mean weighted F1 score of LISI. Visualizations, such as UMAP plots, further revealed that spatiAlign effectively separated clusters while simultaneously integrating slices, unlike some of the other methods that struggled with either task.

- Protein function"	Tie_Low	Copilot has 100s of tags! Major issues - limit of 5-10x and usccint words/statements not this and redundant.	2026-01-29T18:09:34.980038
PMC11659980	dataset/provenance	The data is all curated from the NCBI RefSeq database. There are 173,666, 99,945, 28,081 data points for the three GO categories, MF, BP, and CC, repectively (three sub-tasks). The minimum positive points of each label is set to 50. Because we formulate the plasmid protein function prediction as a multi-class, multi-label classification on 377 labels (172 MF labels + 174 BP labels + 31 CC labels), we can't show all the detailed number of positive/negative points for the 377 binary classifications here. However, you can check more detailed information from the Supplementary Figure S3 in the manuscript. Because we manually curated the dataset based on the RefSeq database, the protein sequences and their GO annotations are very reliable.	"The primary dataset utilized in this work is the publicly available NCBI RefSeq plasmid database. This database is chosen for its rigorous quality assurance checks, which ensure high-quality protein databases and mitigate incorrect Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. The RefSeq database also provides genomic context information, such as the order in which proteins are encoded in the plasmid, a crucial feature for our tool that is not available in other protein-only databases like Swiss-Prot.

We initially downloaded all available plasmids from the NCBI RefSeq plasmid database, along with their corresponding protein sequences translated from coding sequences (CDSs), excluding pseudogenes. These plasmids can be stored in a dictionary format where the keys are plasmids and the values are lists of proteins arranged in the order they are encoded in the respective plasmids. The focus of this work is on proteins in regular plasmids, so we only kept plasmids with lengths between 1K and 350K to ensure each plasmid has at least one encoded protein and no megaplasmids are included.

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. For each GO category, 10% of the most recently released proteins with GO annotations are allocated as the test set. The remaining 90% of annotated proteins are further divided into training and validation sets based on their sequence similarity to the test set. This splitting strategy ensures that the test set significantly differs from the training set in terms of protein sequences, posing significant challenges for both our tool and other deep learning methods.

The curated dataset includes specific information about the number of sentences, deduplicated proteins, and annotated proteins for each GO category. For example, the Molecular Function (MF) category has 173,666 sentences, 99,806 deduplicated proteins, and a training set size of 56,491 sentences. The Biological Process (BP) category has 89,835 sentences, 678,197 deduplicated proteins, and a training set size of 99,945 sentences. The Cellular Component (CC) category has 28,081 sentences, 21,228 deduplicated proteins, and a training set size of 4,045 sentences.

This dataset has been used in previous studies and by the community for GO term prediction tasks, demonstrating its meaningfulness and reliability despite the long-standing issue of incompleteness in the GO annotation domain. As GO annotations continue to expand over time, the problem of incompleteness is expected to gradually improve. Therefore, using the RefSeq database allows our model to better capture the distinctive features of plasmid-encoded proteins with reduced noise and misinterpretation."

PMC11659980	dataset/splits	There are three sub-tasks for our tool, namely the GO term classifications on the MF, BP, and CC categories, respectively. The detailed training/validation/test ratios for the three sub-tasks are 99,806/56,491/17,369, 60,143/29,768/10,034, and 21,228/4,045/2,808. You might find that the splitting ratio is not fixed, because we curated this dataset by simulating the novel protein function prediction scenario. Specifically, for each GO category, we allocated 10% of the most recently released proteins with GO annotations as the test set. Additionally, we ensure that the novel test set significantly differs from the training set in terms of protein sequences. Therefore, among the remaining 90% annotated proteins, those lacking significant alignments (E-value>1e-3) to the test set were assigned to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set. This splitting strategy poses significant challenges for both PlasGO. Because of the large number of the binary classifications (377), we can't plot all the distributions. However, the data type distributions are roughly consistent for the training, validation, and test sets.	"For our experiments, we employed a rigorous data splitting strategy to ensure robust evaluation of the PlasGO model. We allocated 10% of the most recently released proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) annotations as the test set. This test set was designed to significantly differ from the training set in terms of protein sequences. Among the remaining 90% of annotated proteins, those lacking significant alignments (E-value > 1e-3) to the test set were assigned to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set.

This splitting strategy was applied to three GO categories: Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP), and Cellular Component (CC). The specific details of the dataset, including the number of sentences (plasmid sentences composed of multiple proteins) and the number of deduplicated proteins, are provided in Table 1.

For the MF category, the dataset consists of 173,666 sentences, with 99,806 deduplicated proteins. The training set includes 56,491 sentences, the validation set includes 17,369 sentences, and the test set includes 17,369 sentences.

For the BP category, the dataset consists of 89,835 sentences, with 678,197 deduplicated proteins. The training set includes 99,945 sentences, the validation set includes 60,143 sentences, and the test set includes 29,768 sentences.

For the CC category, the dataset consists of 28,081 sentences, with 21,228 deduplicated proteins. The training set includes 4,045 sentences, the validation set includes 2,808 sentences, and the test set includes 2,808 sentences.

Additionally, we conducted experiments using a plasmid-based data splitting strategy, including four groups of leave-one-genus-out benchmarking experiments and a 5-fold cross-validation. In the leave-one-genus-out experiments, the dataset was split such that proteins from one genus were excluded from the training set and used as the test set. This process was repeated for four different genera. In the 5-fold cross-validation, all complete plasmids were randomly divided into five equal partitions, with each partition assigned to a fold. Within each fold, the annotated proteins from the designated partition comprised the test set, while the remaining annotated proteins constituted the training and validation sets. This ensured that there was no significant alignment between the training and test sets, providing a reliable evaluation of the model's capacity for generalization to novel proteins."

PMC11659980	dataset/redundancy	As described above, the generated test set can serve as a novel protein set compared to the training set. Specficially, the minimum normalized edit distances between the training set and the test set for most of the labels are larger than 0.7 (as shown in Supplementary Figure S4 in the manuscript).	"The datasets were split using a protein-based strategy to simulate real-world scenarios where plasmid sequence data is available, but many encoded proteins lack annotations. For each Gene Ontology (GO) category, 10% of the most recently released proteins with GO annotations were allocated to the test set. This ensures that the test set is novel and significantly differs from the training set in terms of protein sequences.

To enforce independence between the training and test sets, we ensured that there were no significant alignments (E-value > 1e-3) between them. Among the remaining 90% of annotated proteins, those lacking significant alignments to the test set were assigned to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set. This splitting strategy poses significant challenges for both PlasGO and other deep learning methods.

The distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in terms of ensuring novelty and independence between training and test sets. This approach helps in evaluating the generalization capability of the models to novel proteins. Additionally, plasmids containing more than 56 proteins were divided into multiple segments with an overlap of 14 proteins to ensure comprehensive coverage during training and prediction.

The curated dataset was utilized for retraining all benchmarked tools, and a comprehensive overview of its specific details can be found in the supplementary materials. Furthermore, experiments conducted using a plasmid-based data splitting strategy, including leave-one-genus-out benchmarking experiments and 5-fold cross-validation, are detailed in the supplementary sections. These experiments demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the PlasGO model across different GO categories."	Tie_Low	redundancy	2026-01-29T18:13:05.833159

The curated dataset, which includes the data splits used for training, validation, and testing, is also publicly available. This dataset is designed to simulate real scenarios where plasmid sequence data are available, but a majority of the encoded proteins lack annotations. For each Gene Ontology (GO) category, 10% of the most recently released proteins with GO annotations were allocated as the test set. The remaining 90% of annotated proteins were split into training and validation sets, ensuring that the novel test set significantly differs from the training set in terms of protein sequences.

To enforce the data splitting strategy, we ensured that there were no significant alignments (E-value > 1e-3) between the training and test sets. This was achieved by assigning proteins lacking significant alignments to the test set to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set. This splitting strategy poses significant challenges for both PlasGO and other deep learning methods.

PMC11659980	optimization/algorithm	We employed deep learning in our tool. PlasGO consists of three sub-modules, a pre-trained protein language model, a global BERT model, and a classifier module incorporating a self-attention confidence weighting mechanism. The core part of PlasGO is the BERT model to learn the global context within plasmid sentences. We used the BERT model because we formuated plasmids as a language defined on the protein token set, and BERT is one of the state-of-the-art language models.	"The machine-learning algorithm class used in our work is deep learning, specifically leveraging transformer-based models. We employed a BERT-like architecture for PlasGO, which is designed to handle protein sequences and predict Gene Ontology (GO) terms. This approach is not entirely new, as BERT and its variants have been widely used in natural language processing and, more recently, in bioinformatics for protein analysis. However, our implementation is tailored for plasmid-encoded proteins, which sets it apart from general-purpose models.

The reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our primary focus is on the biological application and the specific challenges posed by plasmid-encoded proteins. The innovation lies in the adaptation and specialization of existing deep learning techniques for this particular domain, rather than the development of a entirely new algorithm. Our work contributes to the field of bioinformatics by demonstrating the effectiveness of transformer models in predicting GO terms for plasmid-encoded proteins, a task that has unique complexities due to the nature of plasmids.

We also compared our model with other state-of-the-art tools, including gLM, ESM-2, and CodonBERT, among others. For a fair comparison, we optimized these tools using the same curated RefSeq dataset. This involved retraining some models and creating custom databases or classifiers for others. The optimization process was necessary because the default models of these tools were not specifically trained on plasmid-encoded proteins and lacked some of the labels we were interested in predicting. For instance, the default PFresGO model could only predict a subset of our label set, and its performance was significantly improved after retraining on our dataset. This optimization ensured that the benchmarking results were consistent and reflective of each tool's potential when applied to plasmid-encoded proteins."

PMC11659980	optimization/meta	No. There is no data from other ML algorithms as input to PlasGO.	"The model does not operate as a traditional meta-predictor that combines outputs from multiple machine-learning algorithms. Instead, it leverages embeddings from pre-trained language models to enhance its predictions. Specifically, the model utilizes embeddings from the ESM-2 family, particularly the esm2_t36_3B_UR50D model, which has 36 Transformer layers and 3 billion parameters. This choice was made to maintain consistency with the ProtT5 model employed for PlasGO.

The training data splitting strategy ensures that there is no significant alignment between the training and test sets. This approach avoids the use of sequence alignment tools like Diamond, as the focus is on the model's ability to generalize from the training data to novel proteins. The dataset is curated to include a diverse range of plasmid-encoded proteins, with specific attention to ensuring that the test set contains proteins that are significantly different from those in the training set. This strategy poses challenges for both PlasGO and other deep learning methods, as it requires the model to learn from a varied and independent dataset.

For the benchmarking process, several state-of-the-art tools were optimized for GO term prediction using the same curated RefSeq dataset. This included retraining models for the first four tools, utilizing learned embeddings for ESM-2 and CodonBERT, and creating a custom database for TM-Vec. The optimization process was necessary because some labels in the default models did not exist, and the proteins used to train these models spanned various organisms with less emphasis on plasmids. As a result, the retrained models showed significant improvements in performance metrics such as Fmax and AUPR.

The model training involved dividing plasmids into sentences composed of multiple proteins, with an overlap to ensure continuity. This approach was used to convert plasmids into a format suitable for training and prediction. The training process included techniques such as dropout, model simplification, regularization, early stopping, and cross-validation to prevent overfitting. The learning rate was gradually increased using a warm-up strategy, and the model was trained for 10 epochs using an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Blower 24G graphics card.

In summary, while the model does not function as a meta-predictor in the traditional sense, it integrates embeddings from pre-trained language models to enhance its predictive capabilities. The training data is carefully curated to ensure independence between the training and test sets, and various optimization techniques are employed to improve performance and generalization."

PMC11659980	optimization/encoding	We employed the powerful foundation protein languange model, ProtTrans, to encode our input protein sequences. It can generate biologically meaningful embedding for each plasmid-encoded protein. Then, the raw input embeddings can greatly improve the performance of GO term prediction through transfer learning. 	"For the data encoding and preprocessing, we began by selecting the RefSeq dataset due to its rigorous quality assurance checks, which ensure high-quality protein databases with minimal incorrect GO annotations. This dataset also provides genomic context information, such as the order of proteins encoded in plasmids, which is crucial for our model.

We downloaded all available plasmids from the NCBI RefSeq plasmid database, along with their corresponding protein sequences translated from CDSs, excluding pseudogenes. These plasmids were stored in a dictionary format, where each key represents a plasmid and the value is a list of proteins arranged in the order they are encoded in the respective plasmids. We focused on regular plasmids, keeping only those with lengths between 1K and 350K to ensure each plasmid had at least one encoded protein and to exclude megaplasmids.

To prepare the data for training, we restricted the maximum protein length to 1 Kbp. This limit is computationally efficient for the Transformer architecture used in our model and is a common practice followed by many state-of-the-art protein-related methods. However, during the prediction phase or when utilizing our tool, no length restrictions are imposed.

For each GO category, we allocated 10% of the most recently released proteins with GO annotations as the test set. We ensured that the novel test set significantly differed from the training set in terms of protein sequences. Among the remaining 90% of annotated proteins, those lacking significant alignments (E-value > 1e-3) to the test set were assigned to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set. This splitting strategy posed significant challenges for both our model and other deep learning methods.

Plasmids containing more than 56 proteins were divided into multiple segments with an overlap of 14 proteins (1/4 of the maximum length). This approach allowed us to convert plasmids into sentences for our model's training and prediction. The curated dataset was utilized for retraining all benchmarked tools, ensuring a fair and consistent comparison of algorithms."

PMC11659980	optimization/parameters	The parameter number is 13340504 for MF model, 13698908 for BP model, and 6891070 for CC model. Actually, the three models are all simple BERT models with hidden_size = 512, head_num = 8. Besides, we used 4 Transformer layers for MF and BP, and 2 Transformer layers for CC, considering the relatively smaller dataset size and label size for CC.	"In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varies depending on the protein language model (PLM) employed. The core module of PlasGO is structured as a lightweight BERT model with a fixed hidden size of 512 and a varying number of Transformer layers. Specifically, we used 4 Transformer encoder layers for the Molecular Function (MF) and Biological Process (BP) categories, and 2 layers for the Cellular Component (CC) category. This decision was based on the relatively smaller dataset and label size for the CC category.

For the PLMs, we tested several models with different parameter counts. The standard model used was ProtT5 with approximately 3 billion parameters. Additionally, we evaluated more lightweight ESM models with 150 million, 35 million, and 8 million parameters to assess the model's performance across a spectrum of PLMs with varying parameter counts. This flexibility allows users to choose a PLM that aligns with their computational capabilities, ensuring that PlasGO can be effectively utilized even with limited resources."

"The input features for the PlasGO model are derived from protein sequences, which are converted into sentences for training and prediction.

The specific details of the curated dataset, including the number of sentences and proteins, are outlined in a dedicated table.

Feature selection was implicitly performed through the dataset curation process. The training set was carefully constructed to ensure that it did not contain proteins with significant alignments to the test set, thereby focusing on unique and novel protein sequences. This approach helps in preventing data leakage and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

The feature selection process was conducted using only the training set, adhering to best practices in machine learning to avoid bias and ensure the robustness of the model's performance. This strategy poses significant challenges for both PlasGO and other deep learning methods, as it requires the model to learn from a diverse set of protein sequences without relying on similar sequences in the test set."

PMC11659980	optimization/fitting	We have 89,835 plasmid sentences in total for training the simplified global BERT model with token classification task. As shown above, the simplest BERT model (CC) have hyperparameter of hidden_size=512, head_num=8, and layer_num=2. The corpus size (89,835) is sufficient to fit the BERT module. In addition, there are several overfitting strategies in the PlasGO models, which will be listed in V.7.	"The PlasGO model was designed with careful consideration of both overfitting and underfitting. To address the potential issue of overfitting, several strategies were employed. Dropout layers were applied at various stages of the model, including after token embedding layers, multi-head self-attention layers, feed-forward networks within Transformer encoders, and contextualized embeddings learned by the BERT module. This helped to prevent the model from becoming too reliant on specific patterns in the training data.

Model simplification was another key strategy. For instance, the number of Transformer encoder layers was adjusted based on the size of the dataset for each Gene Ontology (GO) category. Four layers were used for Molecular Function (MF) and Biological Process (BP) categories, while only two layers were used for the Cellular Component (CC) category, which had a smaller dataset. This approach ensured that the model complexity was appropriate for the amount of available data, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Regularization techniques, such as rank regularization (RR) loss, were integrated into the total loss function. This method aimed to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between low-confidence and high-confidence predictions, further mitigating overfitting. Additionally, early stopping was implemented to halt the training process if the model's performance on the validation set began to deteriorate.

To address underfitting, a warm-up strategy was used, where the learning rate was gradually increased from a small value to 1e-4 over the initial 5% of the total training steps. This approach helped the model to converge more effectively. Furthermore, a 5-fold cross-validation benchmark experiment was conducted to ensure that the model generalized well to unseen data.

The training process involved converting plasmids into sentences, with plasmids containing more than 56 proteins being divided into multiple segments with an overlap of 14 proteins. This method ensured that the model could handle varying lengths of plasmid-encoded proteins effectively. The final step in the training process involved fine-tuning the model with high-confidence pseudo-labeling, inspired by the iterative alignment tool PSI-BLAST. This strategy dynamically learned the optimal confidence cutoff for improved prediction accuracy.

In summary, the PlasGO model was trained with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 1e-4. Dropout rates of 0.2 for CC and 0.1 for MF and BP were applied to prevent overfitting. The model's performance was evaluated using protein-centric Fmax and term-centric area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) metrics, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of its predictive accuracy."

PMC11659980	optimization/regularization	Yes. 1) Dropout layers adopted on both the classifier FC layer and also the attention blocks in the BERT model. 2) Validation set is employed to prevent overfitting. 3) Layer Normalization is employed for each Transformer block and also the token embedding layer. 4) A rank regularization method is utilized in the classifier module to promote the ability of the model to distinguish low-confidence and high-confidence predictions. For more details, please check the Supplementary Section S1.  	"In our study, several techniques were employed to prevent overfitting in the PlasGO model. One of the key methods used was dropout, which was applied after various layers including token embedding layers, multi-head self-attention layers, feed-forward networks within the Transformer encoders, and contextualized embeddings learned by the BERT module. This technique helps to reduce overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero at each update during training time, which prevents units from co-adapting too much.

Another technique involved model simplification. While BERT was utilized to capture plasmid modular patterns, we opted for hyperparameters aligned with the size of the GO term dataset. For instance, we employed fewer Transformer encoder layers for the Cellular Component (CC) category due to the relatively smaller dataset and label size for this category.

Additionally, a rank regularization (RR) loss was integrated into the total loss function. This regularization method aimed to enhance the model’s capacity to differentiate between low-confidence and high-confidence predictions. It discourages the assignment of high confidence scores to all predictions, thereby preventing overfitting.

Early stopping was also implemented, where the training process would halt if the performance on the validation set began to deteriorate. This ensures that the model does not continue to learn noise from the training data.

Furthermore, a 5-fold cross-validation benchmark experiment was carried out. This approach helps in providing a more reliable evaluation of the model’s capacity for generalization to novel proteins."	Tie_High		2026-01-29T18:23:56.060584

"The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedules used for the PlasGO model are detailed within the publication. Specifically, the model was trained with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 1e-4. A warm-up strategy was employed, allocating 5% of the total training steps to gradually increase the learning rate from a small value to 1e-4. The learning rate was then linearly decayed to enhance generalization and expedite convergence. Different dropout rates were applied based on the GO category: 0.2 for the Cellular Component (CC) category and 0.1 for Molecular Function (MF) and Biological Process (BP) categories.

PMC11659980	model/interpretability	The model is interpretable. We mainly interpreted the global BERT module of PlasGO by comparing the raw embeddings generated from the ProtTrans model and the contextualized embeddings from the global BERT module. You can check the results from Figure 7 in the manuscript. The results showed thats suggests that PlasGO effectively captures the latent features associated with plasmid-specific functions.	"The PlasGO model is designed with a focus on interpretability, aiming to provide insights into its decision-making process. It is not a black-box model; instead, it incorporates several transparent components that allow for a clearer understanding of how predictions are made.

One of the key aspects of PlasGO's interpretability is its use of a foundation protein language model (PLM) to generate biologically meaningful embeddings for each plasmid-encoded protein. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of individual amino acids and their contextual relationships within the protein sequence. By using a global average pooling operation, the model condenses these embeddings into a single per-protein embedding, which serves as the raw input for subsequent modules.

The model's architecture includes a BERT module, which utilizes a fully connected (FC) layer to transform the original embeddings learned by the PLM into protein embeddings. Multiple Transformer encoders are employed to capture the global context between these protein embeddings. This process allows the model to understand the relationships between different proteins encoded in the plasmid, providing a more comprehensive view of the plasmid's genetic structure.

Additionally, the classifier in PlasGO generates a GO term probability vector along with a confidence score vector for each protein. This dual-output mechanism ensures that only high-confidence predictions are retained, enhancing the accuracy of the GO term annotations. The confidence scores provide a measure of the model's certainty in its predictions, making it easier to interpret and trust the results.

Furthermore, the self-attention mechanism within the BERT module helps in identifying which parts of the input sequence are most influential in making a prediction. This attention weighting can be visualized to understand which proteins or amino acids are contributing most to the final output, adding another layer of interpretability.

In summary, PlasGO's design incorporates several transparent components, including the use of PLMs for embedding generation, Transformer encoders for contextual understanding, and a confidence weighting mechanism for reliable predictions. These features make PlasGO a model that is not only powerful in its predictions but also interpretable in its decision-making process."

PMC11659980	model/output	Classification.	"The model is designed for multilabel classification. Specifically, it focuses on predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms for proteins. The output of the model consists of high-confidence predicted GO terms for each protein. These predictions are generated by a classifier module that employs a self-attention confidence weighting mechanism. This mechanism helps in assigning confidence scores to each prediction, allowing the model to reject uncertain predictions and retain only those with high confidence.

The classifier module uses two branches: one for learning logits and another for learning confidence scores. The logits undergo attention-weighting based on the learned confidence scores, ensuring that the final predictions are reliable. The model outputs both the confidence score vector and the final predicted probability vector, which are used to determine the high-confidence GO term predictions in nominal format.

The model's architecture is tailored for multilabel classification, where each protein can be associated with multiple GO terms. This approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of the predictions by leveraging contextual information at the plasmid level. The use of a self-attention mechanism ensures that the model can handle the complexities involved in capturing functional factors such as protein domains or amino acids, providing robust and accurate predictions."

PMC11659980	model/duration	The running speed of PlasGO is very fast. For the 365 plasmid proteins in the example data, it only took 1m48s for the GO term prediction on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. 	The execution time for the PlasGO model varies depending on the phase and the specific protein language model (PLM) used. During the training phase, the time required ranges from approximately 23 minutes to 23 hours, depending on the PLM. For instance, using ProtT5 with 3 billion parameters takes around 23 hours, while the ESM-2 model with 8 million parameters requires about 23 minutes. The prediction phase is significantly faster, taking only a few seconds per run, regardless of the PLM employed. This efficiency is attributed to the lightweight design of PlasGO's core module, which features a fixed hidden size of 512 and a limited number of Transformer layers. Additionally, the preprocessing step, which involves extracting per-protein embeddings, can be more resource-intensive when using larger PLMs. However, users can opt for lighter models or knowledge distillation methods to reduce computational demands. For those without GPU access, plasmid annotation can still be performed by running protein alignment against a pre-compiled database.

PMC11659980	evaluation/method	We conducted a series of rigorous experiments to evaluate the performance of PlasGO. All of them can be checked in the manuscript's Results part. Specifically, they include 1) the performance on the novel RefSeq test set, 2) two ablation studies for validating PlasGO’s design rationale, 3) visualization of the PlasGO embeddings for interpreting the BERT module, 4) identification of elusive GO term labels to improve the precision of PlasGO, 5) labels of different frequencies and confidence scores which show the performance stability on different labels and the effectiveness of the learned confidence scores, 6) application: automatic GO prediction for unannotated plasmid-encoded proteins in RefSeq, which pre-annotates high-confidence GO terms for all available plasmid proteins (678,197), 7) case study: annotations for two well-studied conjugative plasmids associated with AMR.	"The evaluation of PlasGO involved several rigorous methods to ensure its performance and generalizability. We employed a leave-one-genus-out strategy, where proteins from specific genera were excluded from the training set and used as test sets. This approach assessed PlasGO's ability to predict functions for proteins from genera not represented in the training data. The performance was measured using Fmax and AUPR metrics across three Gene Ontology (GO) categories: Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP), and Cellular Component (CC).

Additionally, we conducted a 5-fold cross-validation with a plasmid-based data splitting strategy. This involved randomly dividing all complete plasmids into five equal partitions, with each partition serving as the test set in one fold. The remaining partitions constituted the training and validation sets. This method ensured no significant alignment between the training and test sets, providing a reliable evaluation of PlasGO's capacity for generalization to novel proteins.

For the novel protein benchmark experiments, we allocated 10% of the most recently released proteins with GO annotations as the test set, ensuring significant differences in protein sequences from the training set. The remaining 90% of annotated proteins were split into training and validation sets based on sequence alignment criteria.

The performance metrics used were Fmax, which measures the accuracy of assigning GO terms to a protein, and AUPR, which evaluates the accuracy of predicting which proteins are associated with a given GO term. These metrics were averaged across the different experiment groups to provide a comprehensive assessment of PlasGO's performance.

Overall, the evaluation methods demonstrated PlasGO's superior performance in predicting GO-based functions of plasmid-encoded proteins, even when dealing with novel genera or proteins not seen during training."	B_Better		2026-01-29T18:29:38.687577

"In the evaluation of PlasGO, we employed two commonly used metrics in the CAFA challenge to assess the performance of our tool. These metrics are the protein-centric Fmax and the term-centric area under the precision–recall curve (AUPR).

Fmax measures the accuracy of assigning Gene Ontology (GO) terms to a protein. It provides a single score that balances precision and recall, giving an overall measure of a tool's performance in correctly predicting GO terms for proteins.

AUPR, on the other hand, evaluates the accuracy of predicting which proteins are associated with a given GO term. It is particularly useful for handling imbalanced datasets, where some GO terms may be rare. By using AUPR, we can ensure a more comprehensive assessment of the tools' performance, especially for low-frequency GO terms.

The use of both Fmax and AUPR metrics is representative of the current literature in the field. These metrics are widely accepted and used in the community for evaluating the performance of GO term prediction tools. They provide a balanced view of a tool's performance, considering both the overall accuracy and the handling of rare GO terms.

In our experiments, we calculated Fmax for each protein and AUPR for each GO term separately. We then averaged these individual metrics to obtain an overall performance evaluation. This approach ensures that our assessment is thorough and considers the performance across all proteins and GO terms.

In summary, the reported metrics are representative of the literature and provide a comprehensive evaluation of PlasGO's performance in predicting GO terms for plasmid-encoded proteins."	B_Better		2026-01-29T18:29:56.491211
PMC11659980	evaluation/comparison	Because the RefSeq test set we curated is to simulate the novel protein function prediction scenario, we didn't include any alignment-based tools for benchmarking, such as Diamond and BLASTP. Additionally, we conducted the benchmarking experiments with six learning-based state-of-the-art tools, including DeepGOPlus, PFresGO, TALE, DeepSeq, TM-Vec, and CaLM. For a fair comparison, we retrained all of them using our curated RefSeq dataset (training/validation/test). The results showed that PlasGO performed the best on all three GO categories (Figure 6 in the manuscript).	"In our evaluation, we conducted a thorough comparison of PlasGO with several publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we benchmarked PlasGO against the top three state-of-the-art tools using two key metrics: Fmax and AUPR. These comparisons were performed across three Gene Ontology (GO) categories: Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP), and Cellular Component (CC).

To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we employed multiple strategies. First, we performed leave-one-genus-out experiments, where proteins from a specific genus were excluded from the training set and used as the test set. This approach allowed us to assess PlasGO's ability to generalize to proteins from genera not represented in the training data. The results, depicted in Supplementary Figure S4, showed that PlasGO consistently outperformed the other tools in terms of both Fmax and AUPR across all three GO categories.

Additionally, we conducted a 5-fold cross-validation using a plasmid-based data splitting strategy. In this method, all complete plasmids were randomly divided into five equal partitions, with each partition serving as the test set in one of the folds. The performance was averaged across the five folds, and the results, illustrated in Supplementary Figure S5, demonstrated that PlasGO maintained superior performance compared to the other benchmarked tools.

We also performed ablation studies to validate the design rationale of PlasGO. These studies involved comparing PlasGO with simpler baselines, such as a 3-layer deep neural network (DNN) classifier using ProtT5 embeddings. The results, presented in Table 2, indicated that PlasGO's standard approach, which leverages plasmid-level contextual information, achieved higher Fmax and AUPR scores than the baseline methods.

Furthermore, we computed the all-against-all normalized McNemar test statistic between the ground truth, PlasGO, and other benchmarked tools on the MF category. PlasGO exhibited the lowest test statistic value compared to the ground truth, suggesting its superior performance on the RefSeq test set.

In summary, our evaluation included comparisons with publicly available methods and simpler baselines, demonstrating PlasGO's robust performance and generalizability across various benchmark datasets and experimental setups."

PMC11659980	evaluation/confidence	No. The two evaluation metrics do not relate to confidence intervals. For more details, please refer to the CAFA challanges.	"In the evaluation of PlasGO, we employed several statistical methods to assess the significance of our results and the confidence in our performance metrics.

To compare the performance of PlasGO with other tools, we used the McNemar’s test, a non-parametric statistical test suitable for paired nominal data. This test helped us evaluate the significance of differences in performance between PlasGO and other benchmarked tools. The McNemar test statistic, χ2, was calculated for each pair of tools, and a significant χ2 value allowed us to reject the null hypothesis of equal marginal distributions, indicating a significant difference in performance.

The results of the McNemar’s test are visually represented in a matrix that illustrates the all-against-all normalized test statistics between the ground truth, PlasGO, and other tools. A value close to 1 in this matrix signifies a significant difference, while a value approaching 0 indicates no significant difference. PlasGO consistently showed the lowest test statistic value compared to the ground truth, suggesting superior performance.

Additionally, we introduced a self-attention confidence weighting mechanism in PlasGO, which enables the evaluation of a confidence score for each GO prediction. These confidence scores are crucial for generating reliable GO predictions. In our high-confidence mode, predictions with a probability below a certain threshold and a low confidence score are excluded, resulting in higher AUPR scores but a lower prediction rate. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of the learned confidence scores in enhancing the reliability of GO predictions.

Furthermore, we conducted leave-one-genus-out experiments and 5-fold cross-validation to assess the generalizability and robustness of PlasGO. The performance metrics, Fmax and AUPR, were evaluated across different GO categories and compared with top benchmarked tools. The results showed that PlasGO outperformed other tools in terms of both metrics, indicating its superior capability to predict GO-based functions of plasmid-encoded proteins, even for those from genera not represented in the training data.

In summary, the statistical significance of our results is supported by the McNemar’s test, and the confidence in our performance metrics is enhanced by the self-attention confidence weighting mechanism. These evaluations collectively demonstrate the superiority and reliability of PlasGO in predicting GO terms for plasmid-encoded proteins."	B_Better		2026-01-29T18:32:48.229587

PMC11899596	dataset/provenance	The Human Connectome Project's Young Adult dataset was used for functional MRI data. This dataset is widely used and well established in MRI analysis.	"The dataset used in this study is sourced from the Human Connectome Project–Young Adult Study, which is available via the HCP after registering. The specific resource for accessing and handling the public dataset is the WU-Minn HCP 1200 Subjects Data Release. This dataset includes imaging and nonimaging data, providing a comprehensive starting point for our analysis.

The number of subjects in our study varied depending on the functional MRI (fMRI) modality. For resting-state fMRI, there were 999 subjects, while the gambling task included 1,077 subjects. The number of subjects with complete data for all tasks, which were included in our combined task analysis, was 999. This dataset has been utilized in previous research and by the community, as evidenced by its availability and the development of new imaging protocols and file formats by the HCP.

The dataset has been extensively used in the scientific community, with various studies and analyses building upon it. The availability of this dataset has facilitated the development of new methodologies and tools, such as the open-source software framework we have created for connectome-based predictive modeling. This framework is designed to handle the unique challenges posed by the HCP's imaging data, including the need for cluster computing and the use of open-source software to adapt and build upon existing solutions."

PMC11899596	dataset/splits	We used internal cross-validation (k-fold validation) with a k of 128. We also used a large number of subjects varied between 999 and 1077 according to the respective analysis. Distribution of data types did thus not differ between train and test sets.	"The dataset utilized in this study was derived from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Young Adult Study. The primary analysis involved multiple functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) modalities, each with a varying number of subjects due to the availability of complete data.

The number of subjects differed between fMRI modalities, ranging from 999 for resting-state fMRI to 1,077 for the gambling task. Specifically, the emotion task included 1,041 subjects, the language task had 1,007 subjects, the relational task included 1,034 subjects, the social cognition task had 1,042 subjects, and the working memory task included 1,074 subjects.

For the combined task analysis, which required complete data for all tasks, 999 subjects were included. This subset of subjects had data available for all the fMRI modalities mentioned above.

The demographic variables were similar across the groups, with a predominance of female participants and a majority of white individuals (approximately 75%). The median age across all groups was 29 years. The body mass index (BMI) distribution indicated that more than half of the subjects were either overweight or obese, with a median BMI in the lower overweight range. A small minority of subjects were underweight.

The data splits were determined by the availability of complete datasets for each fMRI modality and the combined task analysis. The primary splits were based on the different fMRI tasks, with the combined task analysis representing a subset of subjects who had complete data across all tasks. This approach ensured that the analysis was robust and that the models could be trained and tested on a diverse and representative sample of the population."

PMC11899596	dataset/redundancy	Our dataset was split fold-wise into test and train sets randomly. Since the dataset contains some data from siblings, we took care not to split siblings into corresponding train/test pairs.	"The datasets were split using a k-fold cross-validation approach, ensuring that each subject was used as a test subject exactly once. This method helps to maintain the independence of training and test sets, as the model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold, with this process repeated k times.

To enforce independence, especially considering the genetic influences on both BMI and functional connectivity, siblings were removed from each fold before model building. This step was crucial to prevent closely related subjects from predicting each other's BMI, thereby avoiding any genetic confounding effects.

The distribution of the study population is summarized in a table, highlighting that the number of subjects varied between different fMRI modalities, ranging from 999 for resting-state fMRI to 1,077 for the gambling task. The combined task analysis included 999 subjects who had complete data for all tasks. Demographic variables were similar across groups, with a predominance of female participants and a majority of white individuals. Additionally, more than half of the subjects were classified as having overweight or obesity based on their BMI.

This approach ensures that the datasets are robust and that the results are not biased by genetic relatedness, providing a more reliable prediction of BMI using functional connectivity data. The study's focus on removing siblings from each fold is a notable aspect that distinguishes it from previously published machine learning datasets, which may not have accounted for genetic influences in the same manner."

PMC11899596	optimization/algorithm	"The ML algorithm used is a form of linear regression. Connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) was used as described in [1]. CPM uses simple correlation described by Pearson's r between features (edges of a connectome) and a to-be-predicted measure (in this case, BMI) in the train set. From negative and positive correlations between features and the measure a general linear model is constructed, which is then used to predict the test set's measure.

"	"The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is based on predictive modeling, specifically connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). This approach involves correlating the strength of connections between brain regions with a variable of interest, such as BMI, and then building predictive models based on these correlations.

The algorithm itself is not entirely new but has been adapted and optimized for our specific purposes. We utilized existing software packages, particularly nilearn, which is heavily based on scikit-learn. Scikit-learn is a well-established machine-learning library in Python, known for its efficiency and ease of use. By leveraging scikit-learn, we were able to build upon existing solutions and adapt the code to meet our needs.

The reason the algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our focus was on applying and optimizing these methods for neuroimaging data, specifically for understanding cerebellocerebral connectivity and its prediction of BMI. The innovation lies in the application and adaptation of these techniques to neuroimaging data rather than the development of a entirely new machine-learning algorithm. Our work involves integrating various tools and techniques to create a robust framework for analyzing brain connectivity data, which is more aligned with neuroimaging and biomedical research journals.

Additionally, we employed tangent space-based connectivity matrices, which use a Riemannian manifold transformation. This method has been shown to be more sensitive to intersubject differences and was recommended by previous studies. We also used Ledoit-Wolf's shrinkage estimator for regularization, which is implemented in nilearn. These choices were made to enhance the performance and reliability of our predictive models.

In summary, while the core machine-learning algorithms are not new, their application and optimization for neuroimaging data, along with the integration of various tools and techniques, represent a significant contribution to the field."

PMC11899596	optimization/meta	No data from other ML algorithms was used. 	The model employed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), which is a protocol for establishing relationships between brain functional connectivity and neuroimaging-independent measures. The CPM approach is data-driven and applies cross-validation to mitigate overfitting. This method involves several steps, including random division of subjects into training and testing populations, correlation of connectivity matrix edges with the variable of interest (e.g., BMI), and model building using linear models. The training data is independent because subjects are randomly divided into folds, ensuring that each subject is part of the test population exactly once. Additionally, closely related subjects, such as twins, are removed from each fold to prevent them from predicting each other's BMI, further ensuring the independence of the training data.

PMC11899596	optimization/encoding	A preprocessed version of the Human Connectome Project's (HCP) Young Adults dataset was used. While a comprehensive and detailed description has been published elsewhere [1], a concise description of the steps involved is as follows: In a first step, correction for distortions related to gradient nonlinearity (which is more pronounced in the HCP’s scanner setup) was applied with a FreeSurfer software package. The FSL software’s FLIRT method was then used to correct for head motion. Grand-mean intensity normalization was performed on the fMRI time series. One of the keystones of fMRI studies is reliable intersubject comparability, which requires translating a subject’s physical space into a common standard space (”registering”). The HCP addressed this fundamental issue via multimodal registering, i.e. using a variety of imaging modalities to reliably and automati- cally identify anatomical or functional landmarks in each subject’s 3D data and align them accordingly in what they call grayordi- nate space, a derivate of Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, in which only matter of interest (i.e. gray matter) is preserved. Building on work described in [2], Glasser et al. [3] developed a multi-modal and mapped areal-feature-based (dubbed ”MSMAll”) registration method, which uses myelin maps, resting-state brain networks, visuotopic maps, and a subcortical region of interest for inter-subject alignment (see the supplemental methods of [3] for implementation details).  The analysis is a parcellated analysis. For the cerebral cortex, HCP-MMP1.0 (Human Connectome Project Multi- Modal Parcellation version 1.0, [3]) by Glasser et al. was used. They delineated 180 parcels per hemisphere (360 in total) by using the overlap of four areal feature maps, one for each modality (cortical thickness, relative myelin content, tfMRI, rsfMRI). Subcortical parcels were provided by Tian et al. [4]. They relied on subcortical-to-cortical connectivity derived from the HCP’s rsfMRI data to delineate 27 subcortical parcels per hemisphere (54 in total) along connectivity gradients, i.e. sufficiently stark changes in func tional connectivity. Finally, cerebellar parcels came from a HCP-based study which clustered neighboring cerebellar voxels into 100 parcels by means of similarity of their rsfMRI time-series [5].

"The data encoding and preprocessing for our machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, we utilized a combined parcellation along with auxiliary data to extract time series from MSMall CIFTI files. For resting-state data, we employed the HCP Connectome Workbench software's command-line application to average time series per parcel. This process was facilitated by supplying individual parcels as regions of interest.

For task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI), we prepared the data using Python code based on the HCP pipelines script collection. These time series were then used to calculate connectivity matrices for each subject using the Python package Nilearn's ConnectivityMeasure class. Specifically, for tfMRI, we opted for tangent space-based connectivity matrices, which utilize a Riemannian manifold transformation. This choice was driven by previous findings that tangent-based parametrization and parcellations based on functional connectivity data perform best in connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM).

To ensure the robustness of our connectivity matrices, we applied Ledoit-Wolf's shrinkage estimator as a regularization technique. Given our focus on cerebellocerebral connections, we purged the matrices of connections that were not of interest. This step was crucial as it allowed us to limit our analysis to the connections informed by our hypothesis without imposing further anatomical assumptions.

The resulting correlation-of-interest (COI) matrices, where correlations represent ""edges"" between ""nodes"" (i.e., parcels), served as the foundation for computing predictive networks in our CPM analysis. These matrices were further processed by regressing out nuisance variables such as gender, age, and ethnicity. This yielded two separate networks: one with positively correlated edges and another with negatively correlated edges. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, only edges passing a p-threshold of 0.05 were carried forward to the model-building stage. This thresholding was a means to select ""meaningful"" edges and was not related to the statistical significance of our results, which was established later through permutation analysis."

"In our study, the number of parameters, p, used in the model was determined by the edges in the connectivity matrices that passed a significance threshold. Initially, nuisance variables such as gender, age, and ethnicity were regressed out, yielding two separate networks: one with positively correlated edges and another with negatively correlated edges. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, only edges with a p-value threshold of 0.05 were retained for the subsequent model-building stage. This thresholding process was not related to the statistical significance of the results but served as a means to select ""meaningful"" edges.

The selection of the p-value threshold of 0.05 was based on standard practices in statistical analysis to balance between Type I and Type II errors. This threshold ensured that only edges with a reasonably strong association with the variable of interest (BMI) were included in the model, thereby improving the model's predictive power.

Additionally, the study population was divided into train and test sets using a k-fold cross-validation approach, with k set to 128. This middle-ground approach has been reported to provide robust results and is consistent with our own experiences. The train population's connectivity matrices were used to correlate the edges' weights with the subjects' BMI, further refining the selection of meaningful edges for model building."

PMC11899596	optimization/features	Features in CPM correspond to the edges of the connectome used to predict the measure in question. Since we used a 513 x 513 connectivity matrix (of which 99 x 513 nodes contained values of interest and were used as features), the number of features was comparatively high. They were selected with p < 0.05 as a thresholding mechanism and only selected in the training set. Feature selection and prediction was strictly separated.	"In our study, the input features for the predictive modeling were derived from connectivity matrices, specifically focusing on cerebellocerebral connections. These matrices were computed using time series extracted from MSMall CIFTI files for resting-state fMRI and prepared with Python code based on HCP pipelines for task-based fMRI. The number of features, f, corresponds to the edges in these connectivity matrices, which represent the connections between parcels (nodes) in the brain.

Feature selection was performed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This involved regressing out nuisance variables such as gender, age, and ethnicity, and then retaining only those edges that passed a p-threshold of 0.05. This process yielded two separate networks: one with positively correlated edges and another with negatively correlated edges. The feature selection was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the test set remained independent and unbiased. This approach helped in identifying meaningful edges for model building while maintaining the statistical integrity of the results."	B_Better		2026-01-29T18:48:30.973457
PMC11899596	optimization/fitting	Internal cross-validation and a regularization technique (see below) were used to counteract overfitting.	"In our study, we employed connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to establish relationships between brain functional connectivity and anthropometric measures, such as BMI. This approach is data-driven and utilizes cross-validation to mitigate overfitting.

The number of parameters in our model is indeed much larger than the number of training points, as we are dealing with high-dimensional connectivity matrices. To address the risk of overfitting, we implemented a rigorous cross-validation strategy. Specifically, we divided our subjects into training and test populations using 128 folds. This middle-ground approach has been reported to provide the most solid results and is consistent with our own experience. By evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, we ensure that our findings are robust and not merely a result of overfitting.

To further enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, we only considered edges that passed a p-threshold of 0.05 in our model building stage. This step helps in selecting meaningful edges without compromising the statistical significance of our results, which is established later through permutation analysis.

Additionally, we used tangent space-based connectivity matrices, which have been shown to be more sensitive to inter-subject differences. This choice, along with the use of Ledoit-Wolf's shrinkage estimator for regularization, helps in capturing the true underlying patterns in the data and prevents underfitting.

In summary, our use of cross-validation, edge thresholding, and advanced connectivity measures ensures that our model is neither overfitted nor underfitted, providing reliable predictions of BMI based on cerebellar connectivity."

One key method involved the use of cross-validation, specifically with k = 128 folds. This approach helps to mitigate overfitting by evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, thereby providing a more reliable estimate of its generalizability.

Additionally, we utilized Ledoit-Wolf's shrinkage estimator as a regularization technique. This method is implemented in the Nilearn package and helps to stabilize the covariance matrix estimates, reducing the risk of overfitting, especially in high-dimensional data.

Furthermore, we applied a thresholding process to select meaningful edges in our connectivity matrices. Only edges passing a p-threshold of 0.05 were retained for model building. This step helps to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and ensures that the model focuses on the most relevant connections.

To assess the statistical significance of our results, we employed permutation analysis. This non-parametric method involves repeatedly performing the connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) after permuting the variable of interest (e.g., BMI) within the test population. This approach helps to establish the significance of our predictions while avoiding the pitfalls of parametric testing.

PMC11899596	model/interpretability	It is interpretable as the edges used to predict BMI are documented and, in fact, interpreted in the paper.	"The model employed in our study is not a black box but rather a transparent and interpretable approach. We utilized connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), which is inherently data-driven and does not rely on predefined assumptions beyond those informed by our hypothesis. This method allows for a clear understanding of how brain connectivity relates to the external measure of interest, in this case, BMI.

One of the key advantages of CPM is its use of cross-validation, which helps mitigate overfitting by evaluating model performance on unseen data. This process ensures that the relationships identified between brain connectivity and BMI are robust and generalizable.

The model building process involves several transparent steps. Initially, nuisance variables such as gender, age, and ethnicity are regressed out to isolate the relevant signals. This yields two separate networks: one for positively correlated edges and another for negatively correlated edges. Only edges passing a p-threshold of 0.05 are retained to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.

These networks are then fitted into linear models to describe the relationship between brain area connections and BMI. The positive and negative network models are combined to form a general linear model (GLM). This GLM is used to predict the BMI of a test population, and the process is repeated multiple times through k-fold cross-validation to ensure all subjects are tested once.

Statistical significance is assessed using permutation analysis, which involves repeatedly performing CPM after permuting BMI within the test population. This method provides a robust way to establish the significance of our results without relying on parametric testing.

Additionally, the model's transparency is further enhanced by the use of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI) data. The tasks performed by subjects tap into different domains of cognitive and affective function, providing a rich dataset for analysis. For example, the emotion task included conditions of fear and neutral, where subjects were presented with images of fearful or angry faces and shapes, respectively.

Overall, the model's transparency is evident in its data-driven approach, use of cross-validation, and clear steps in model building and statistical assessment. This ensures that the relationships identified between brain connectivity and BMI are interpretable and reliable."

"The execution time for our model varied depending on the computational resources and the specific analysis being performed. To handle the computational load, our analysis code was designed to utilize parallel and distributed computing. We relied on the Ray framework in its Python-based incarnation to manage these computations efficiently. This approach allowed us to distribute the workload across multiple machines, significantly reducing the overall execution time.

For the task-based analysis, we performed 10,000 permutations to establish statistical significance at P ≤ 0.001, which is a computationally intensive process. Similarly, for the resting state-based analysis, we conducted 2,000 permutations. These permutations were essential for ensuring the robustness of our results and for correcting for multiple comparisons using conservative methods like Bonferroni's correction.

The specific execution time can vary, but the use of high-performance computing clusters, such as the one provided by the Leipzig University Computing Center, enabled us to complete these analyses in a reasonable timeframe.

PMC11899596	evaluation/method	Internal cross-validation was used.	"The method was evaluated using a robust cross-validation approach to ensure the reliability and generalizability of the results. Specifically, connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) was employed, which involves several key steps. Subjects were randomly divided into training and testing populations, with the number of folds set to 128. This middle-ground approach has been reported to provide the most solid results, aligning with our own experiences.

In the training phase, connectivity matrices were used to correlate the strength of connections between brain regions with the subjects' BMI. Nuisance variables such as gender, age, and ethnicity were regressed out to isolate the relevant signals. This process yielded two separate networks: one with positively correlated edges and another with negatively correlated edges. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, only edges passing a p-threshold of 0.05 were retained for further analysis.

The positive and negative networks from the training population were then fitted into linear models to describe the relationship between brain connectivity and BMI. These models were combined to form a general linear model (GLM), which was subsequently used to predict the BMI of the test population. This entire process was repeated for each fold, ensuring that every subject served as a test subject at least once. Finally, Pearson's r was calculated to assess the population-level correlation between the predicted and observed BMI values.

To address the hypothesis of task-independent predictability of BMI, connectivity matrices from different task conditions were averaged. This involved combining all 0-back and 2-back runs into respective conditions and then averaging the connectivity matrices per subject. The task-specific connectivity matrices were further combined and averaged to create a single connectivity matrix per subject, which served as the input for CPM.

Statistical significance was assessed using permutation analysis, which involved repeatedly performing CPM after permuting BMI within the test population. This method helped avoid the pitfalls of parametric testing and established significance at P ≤ 0.001 after correcting for multiple comparisons. The number of permutations was chosen conservatively, with 10,000 permutations for task-based analysis and 2,000 permutations for resting-state-based analysis, satisfying correction methods like Bonferroni’s.

To manage the computational load, the analysis code was designed to utilize parallel and distributed computing. The Ray framework was employed to handle the extensive computational requirements, ensuring that the analysis could be completed efficiently."

PMC11899596	evaluation/measure	Pearson's r of predicted vs observed BMI is reported. This dataset contains data from young and predominantly white adults, a table with basic demographic information is provided in the paper.	"In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the predictive power of our models and the significance of our results. Primarily, we focused on the correlation between predicted and observed Body Mass Index (BMI) using Pearson's correlation coefficient. This metric allowed us to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between the predicted and actual BMI values.

To assess the statistical significance of these correlations, we utilized permutation analysis. This non-parametric method involved repeatedly performing Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling (CPM) after permuting BMI within the test population. By comparing the true prediction to the distribution of permuted predictions, we established significance at a threshold of P ≤ 0.001, ensuring robustness against multiple comparisons through conservative correction methods like Bonferroni's.

Additionally, we explored the overlap between networks predictive of BMI and those predictive of related measures, such as executive function, general cognition, and reward-related self-regulation. This involved calculating Pearson's r for BMI and these measures of interest, followed by CPM on the measures. The resulting predictive networks were compared by multiplying masks of connectivity matrices of significant edges, creating an overlap network. Nodes were ranked based on their weighted degrees averaged over overlapping networks.

These metrics are representative of standard practices in the field, ensuring that our findings are both reliable and comparable to existing literature. The use of permutation analysis, in particular, is a powerful method that aligns with current best practices for assessing the significance of predictive models in neuroimaging studies."

PMC11899596	evaluation/comparison	Does not apply.	"In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. However, our approach was informed by and built upon existing methodologies, particularly those related to connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). We utilized established software and techniques, such as the HCP Connectome Workbench and Nilearn, which are widely used in the field. These tools provided a foundation for our analysis, ensuring that our methods were robust and comparable to existing standards.

We did compare different processing methods for CPM. Specifically, we opted for tangent space–based connectivity matrices, which use a Riemannian manifold transformation. This choice was supported by previous studies that found tangent-based parametrization and parcellations based on functional connectivity data to perform best. We confirmed these findings by producing better predictions following these recommendations.

Additionally, we considered simpler baselines in our analysis. For instance, we used partial correlation for resting-state data but chose tangent space–based connectivity matrices for task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) data. This decision was driven by the need for methods that are more sensitive to intersubject differences, as indicated by prior research.

Our study also involved a detailed comparison of different processing methods for CPM. We explored various techniques and selected those that yielded the most promising results. This iterative process ensured that our final methods were well-justified and effective for our specific research questions.

In summary, while we did not conduct a direct benchmark comparison with other publicly available methods, our approach was thoroughly vetted through comparisons with simpler baselines and informed by established methodologies in the field. This ensured the reliability and validity of our findings."

PMC11899596	evaluation/confidence	We used permutation-based analysis to confirm the statistical validity of the results. No comparable models predicting a similar measure with similar features exists.	"To ensure the robustness of our findings, we employed permutation analysis to assess the statistical significance of our results. This method involved repeatedly performing Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling (CPM) after permuting Body Mass Index (BMI) within the test population. We conducted 10,000 permutations for the task-based analysis and 2,000 permutations for the resting state-based analysis. These numbers were chosen to establish significance at P ≤ 0.001, even after correcting for multiple comparisons using conservative methods like Bonferroni’s correction. This approach allowed us to determine the proportion of permutations that yielded predictions equal to or greater than our true prediction, thereby providing a robust measure of statistical significance.

Additionally, we used Pearson’s correlation to explore the relationships between BMI and other measures of interest, such as executive function, general cognition, and reward-related self-regulation. The results of these correlations were further validated using permutation testing, which confirmed that none of the measures showed a normal distribution in our sample. This non-parametric approach ensured that our findings were not biased by assumptions of normality.

To address the computational challenges associated with permutation analysis, we leveraged parallel and distributed computing. Our analysis code was designed to utilize the Ray framework in its Python-based incarnation, enabling efficient use of multiple computing resources. This allowed us to handle the computational load effectively and ensure that our results were both reliable and reproducible.

In summary, our evaluation confidence is high due to the rigorous statistical methods employed, including permutation analysis and non-parametric testing. These methods, combined with advanced computational techniques, provide a strong foundation for claiming the superiority of our approach over other methods and baselines."

PMC2752621	optimization/algorithm	"Ensemble of a deep Residual Convolutional Neural Networks.	"	"The optimization algorithm employed in our pipeline leverages a supervised machine learning approach to enhance the accuracy of SNP predictions. Specifically, we utilize the J48 classification tree, which is part of the WEKA classifier package. This algorithm is not new; it is a well-established decision tree learner that implements the C4.5 algorithm.

The choice of J48 was driven by its robustness and effectiveness in handling the complex feature sets derived from sequence-based statistics. These features include local and global sequence variation, alignment depth and quality, base quality, and sequence alignment quality. The algorithm was trained on a dataset of 300 sequences, with true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives clearly defined.

The decision to use J48 in this context, rather than publishing it in a machine-learning journal, stems from the specific application and integration within our bioinformatics pipeline. The primary focus of our work is on improving the accuracy and efficiency of SNP identification in re-sequencing data, particularly for highly polymorphic organisms like pine. The machine learning component is a crucial part of this pipeline, but the overall innovation lies in the integration of various tools and techniques to address a specific biological problem. Therefore, the publication in a bioinformatics journal is more appropriate, as it highlights the practical application and impact on the field of genomics."

Specifically, it integrates the results from PolyPhred and Polybayes, which are utilities that rely on quality scores and sequence coverage for SNP identification. These tools are used to generate initial SNP predictions, which are then evaluated by our meta-predictor.

The meta-predictor employs a supervised machine learning algorithm, specifically the J48 classification tree available in the WEKA classifier package. This classifier is trained on a set of features derived from sequence-based statistics, including local and global sequence variation, alignment depth and quality, local and global base quality, and sequence alignment quality. The training data consists of 300 sequences, with true positive and false negative vectors represented as real SNPs, and true negative and false positive vectors as non-SNPs.

PMC2752621	optimization/encoding	Each MHC allele was represented by a pseudo-sequence consisting of 34 amino acid residues in contact with the peptide.  All peptides sequences were padded on the right end to the same length, 30 for class I and 40 for class II, using a place-holder amino acid.     For each MHC- peptide pair, the MHC feature vector and the peptide feature matrix formed a final input matrix of size 1400 x 30 for class I MHC and 1400 x 40 for class II MHC. The difference between the peptide length L and the expected length L (9 for class I MHC and 15 for class II MHC) was encoded using a sigmoid function.	"The data encoding process involved generating a multi-sequence FASTA file from the aligned contig consensus sequences. Each read was aligned to an overall consensus for the amplicon, based on the alignment in the ProbconsRNA output and each read’s alignment to the consensus sequence of its member contig. This multi-sequence aligned FASTA file was then converted back to an ACE formatted file, suitable for input to Polybayes and Polyphred.

For the machine-learning algorithm, sequence-based statistics were derived through a customized feature extraction program. These statistics included local and global sequence variation, alignment depth and quality, local and global base quality, and sequence alignment quality.

PMC2752621	model/interpretability	Black box	"The model employed in our pipeline is not a black box. It leverages a supervised machine learning algorithm, specifically the J48 classification tree available in the WEKA classifier package. This approach ensures transparency and interpretability.

The J48 classification tree is a decision tree algorithm that is easy to understand and interpret. It works by recursively splitting the data based on the feature that provides the most information gain, creating a tree structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of the decision, and each leaf node represents the final class label.

In our case, the features used to train the classification tree include sequence-based statistics that fully represent local and global sequence variation, alignment depth and quality, local and global base quality, and sequence alignment quality. These features are derived through a customized feature extraction program and fed as a vector for each polymorphism to the J48 classification tree.

The resulting tree structure can be visualized and interpreted, providing clear insights into how the model makes predictions. For example, one might observe that a particular split in the tree is based on the alignment depth at a specific position, indicating that this feature is important for distinguishing between true SNPs and non-SNPs.

Moreover, the use of a decision tree allows for easy identification of the most influential features in the prediction process. By examining the tree, one can see which features are used at the top levels of the tree, indicating their importance in the classification task.

In summary, the model used in our pipeline is transparent and interpretable, thanks to the use of a decision tree algorithm. This transparency allows researchers to understand the underlying patterns in the data and the reasoning behind the model's predictions."

"In the evaluation of our pipeline, we focused on key performance metrics to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of our SNP calling process. The primary metrics reported include accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the SNP predictions, providing a comprehensive view of the performance. Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, indicates the proportion of actual SNPs that are correctly identified. Specificity, or the true negative rate, reflects the proportion of non-SNPs that are correctly identified, which is crucial for minimizing false positives.

These metrics are representative of standard evaluations in the field of SNP discovery. Accuracy is a widely used metric that gives an overall sense of the performance, while sensitivity and specificity provide detailed insights into the types of errors made. By reporting these metrics, we ensure that our results are comparable to other studies in the literature, allowing for a fair assessment of our pipeline's performance.

In our tests, the classification tree achieved an accuracy of 93.6%, demonstrating a significant improvement over existing tools like Polyphred and Polybayes, which had accuracies of 76.25% and 78.02%, respectively. Sensitivity was reported at 88.21%, indicating a high rate of true positive identifications. Specificity was exceptionally high at 98.73%, showing that our method is highly effective at correctly identifying non-SNPs, which is vital for reducing false positives.

ProbconsRNA, while highly accurate, was found to be inhibitive in terms of speed for high-throughput studies. Additionally, the classification tree generated from the training sequences was tested against a unique set of 120 sequences with 563 manually validated SNPs, showing a calculated accuracy of 93.6%.

The performance of PineSAP was also compared to simpler baselines such as Phrap alone with default parameters. Phrap placed 23% of the amplicons in a single contig, 27% into two, and 20% into three. Amplicons with two or more contigs could be forced into a single contig 82% of the time, but there were problems with the alignment in 34% of cases. In contrast, the alignment method implemented in PineSAP improved the success rate to 98%.

Furthermore, the SNP calling accuracy of PineSAP was compared to Polyphred and Polybayes. These utilities rely primarily on quality scores and sequence coverage and achieved at best 78% prediction accuracy in tests utilizing loblolly pine, with the majority of discrepancies resulting from false positives. The classification tree used in PineSAP resulted in a significant overall improvement, with an accuracy of 93.6%, sensitivity of 88.21%, and specificity of 98.73%."

An ES cell line with Dox-inducible Flag-tagged Cdx2 was generated and used to perform anti-Flag ChIP-seq experiments. These experiments were conducted after 24 hours of Dox-induced expression of Cdx2 in ES cells, as well as in motor neuron progenitors and endoderm cells differentiated from the same ES cell line. Mock IP control experiments were also performed using the same system.

The sequenced ChIP-seq reads were mapped to the mm9 reference genome using Bowtie. The ChIP-seq data generated during this study have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession numbers GSE39433 and GSE39435.

Additionally, the study utilized 55 mouse ES ChIP-seq and DNaseI-seq experiments gathered from various sources. These experiments were used to train support vector machines (SVMs) for analyzing Cdx2 binding events. The positive training sets were defined from the top-most Cdx2 binding events for each condition-specific and condition-independent permutation, with a maximum of 4,000 binding events. A negative training set of 10,000 matches to the Cdx2 cognate binding motif, which were not bound by Cdx2 in any experiment, was also defined.

The dataset includes simulated multiple condition ChIP-seq datasets, which are available from the same webpage as the MultiGPS software. MultiGPS is an open-source Java package released under the MIT license and can be accessed from http://mahonylab.org/software and https://github.com/shaunmahony/seqcode. These simulated datasets were used to test the relative performance of MultiGPS in defining differential binding events. The simulated data mirrors the properties of real ChIP-seq datasets, with a subset of binding events chosen to be differentially enriched across conditions.

This process was repeated 20 times, each time with a different held-out test set, to calculate average true-positive versus false-positive area under the curve (AUC) values. This method ensured that our results were robust and not dependent on a single random split of the data.

The remaining data, not included in the held-out test sets, were used for training the SVMs. The training sets were defined based on the top-most binding events for each condition-specific and condition-independent permutation, with a maximum of 4,000 binding events. Additionally, a negative training set of 10,000 matches to the Cdx2 cognate binding motif, which were not bound by Cdx2 in any experiment, was included.

The data splits were designed to cover various aspects of the binding events, including reads counted in 1,000 bp windows around positive and negative locations for each of the 55 mouse ES experiments. SVMs were trained on the resulting 55-dimensional vectors without any normalization. Furthermore, k-mer frequencies, motif information, and binding occupancy probabilities were also considered in 200 bp windows around the top-most Cdx2 binding events.

This class of algorithms is well-established in machine learning and statistics for iterative optimization problems, particularly those involving latent variables.

The specific implementation used in our approach, MultiGPS, is not entirely new but is tailored for the analysis of multiple related ChIP-seq experiments. It extends the traditional EM algorithm by incorporating additional mixture components and prior information to handle the complexities of multi-condition ChIP-seq data. This includes modeling noise, sequence dependence, and replicate-specific variations.

The reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of our work is on its application in computational biology, specifically in the analysis of ChIP-seq data. The innovations lie in how the EM framework is adapted to address biological questions related to regulatory protein binding across different conditions. The algorithm's development and application are driven by the need to accurately model and interpret biological data, rather than by the development of novel machine-learning techniques per se. Therefore, the publication venue reflects the biological significance and applications of the method."

PMC3967921	optimization/meta		"The optimization process in MultiGPS does not rely on a meta-predictor approach. Instead, it uses a joint multi-experiment model that considers read data from all experiments to produce accurate location estimates of punctate binding events. The model incorporates various priors, including a sparsity-promoting prior on binding event strengths, a genome sequence-based (motif) prior, and an inter-experiment prior that encourages location coherence across experimental conditions.

The inter-experiment prior is particularly notable as it allows for more effective joint experiment analysis and automatic data-guided event alignment. This prior encourages the base locations of binding events to align across experiments when appropriate, producing coherent sets of binding events that are linked across experiments without any potentially noisy windowed analysis.

The model optimization step determines whether binding positions are separate or shared, using a distribution that generates a sample from {(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)} at each base in the genome. This distribution helps in jointly optimizing two binding sites when they fall within a certain range of each other, typically 100 base pairs. The optimization process is iterative, and in each step, binding events are detected independently in each experiment, allowing for the modeling of experiment-specific parameters such as the distribution of reads around binding events and the properties of background noise.

The use of support vector machines (SVMs) is mentioned in the context of training and classification, but these are not part of the core optimization process of MultiGPS. SVMs are used for training on various features like chromatin state data, k-mer frequencies, and motif information, but they are not integrated as part of a meta-predictor within the optimization framework of MultiGPS."

PMC3967921	optimization/encoding	"""Pre-processing: Input data obtained from MS/MS data, an aqueous soluble protein sample from E.coli lysate was reduced, carbamidomethylated and digested with trypsin."""	"The data encoding process for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, ChIP-seq reads were mapped to the mm9 reference genome using Bowtie. For the analysis of binding events, reads were counted in specific windows around predicted binding sites. For instance, 1,000 bp windows were used for counting reads around positive and negative training locations in mouse ES experiments. Additionally, 200 bp windows were utilized for enumerating k-mer frequencies and other relevant information around the top-most binding events.

In the context of support vector machines (SVMs), the data was encoded into 55-dimensional vectors derived from 55 mouse ES ChIP-seq and DNaseI-seq experiments. These vectors were created by counting reads in the specified windows without any normalization. Furthermore, SVMs were trained on k-mer frequencies, motif log-likelihood ratios, and binding occupancy probabilities within the same 200 bp windows.

For the MultiGPS algorithm, the data was structured to include multiple experimental conditions and replicates. This involved providing input datasets with annotations on how these datasets were related, such as which datasets represented technical or biological replicates and which served as controls. The algorithm then performed semi-independent mixture model training across all provided data, maintaining condition-specific and replicate-specific parameters.

The noise component in the data was modeled using a global distribution, which could be defined as uniform or parameterized using the read density observed in a control experiment. The shape of the noise distribution was defined by smoothing the control experiment’s read counts using a 50 bp sliding window.

Overall, the data encoding process ensured that the machine-learning algorithm could effectively analyze and compare binding events across multiple conditions and replicates, while accounting for noise and specific genomic contexts."

PMC3967921	optimization/parameters	For the SVM, we use a Gaussian kernel, and hyperparameters C (soft margin penalty) and sigma (low case, width of the Gaussian). Hyperparameters are selected using five-fold nested cross-validation, where the parameter with the largest area under the ROC curve is selected.	"In the MultiGPS model, the number of parameters used is not explicitly fixed but rather depends on the specific analysis being conducted. The model incorporates various condition-specific and replicate-specific parameters, including distinct binding event read distributions per replicate, distinct noise component read distributions and mixing probabilities per replicate, and distinct binding motifs per condition.

The selection of these parameters is driven by the goal of maintaining condition-specific and replicate-specific details while also identifying binding event locations that are consistent across conditions. For instance, the model uses a multivariate Bernoulli distribution to generate binding positions, which considers the presence or absence of binding sites in different conditions. The parameters for this distribution, such as the number of binding events (N) and the number of shared binding locations (S), are chosen during each iteration of the algorithm.

The ratio S/N is set to 0.9 in the model, which encourages the coupling of nearby binding event locations across conditions. This ratio can be adjusted within a range (0.5 to 0.99) without significantly affecting the proportion of aligned binding components. The model also incorporates a positional prior to bias the estimated binding locations towards biologically appropriate base positions, which can include motif information.

Additionally, some parameters in MultiGPS are re-estimated periodically for a more efficient and stable training process. This includes the form of the binding event read distribution, the noise component mixing probability, and the binding motif position weight matrix. The model uses a generalized EM algorithm, which increases the expected log likelihood in each M step without necessarily achieving a maximum in each iteration, ensuring convergence to a local optimum."

These vectors were created by counting reads in 1,000 bp windows around positive and negative training locations.

Additionally, SVMs were trained using k-mer frequencies. Specifically, the occurrences of each 4-mer (accounting for reverse-complement redundancies) were enumerated in 200 bp windows around the top-most binding events. Furthermore, three other pieces of information from the same 200 bp windows were used: the maximum log-likelihood ratio score for the motif, the number of motif matches scoring above a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold, and the probability of binding occupancy in the window.

Feature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate step in the process. The features used were determined based on biological relevance and empirical performance, rather than through a formal feature selection procedure on the training set.

PMC3967921	optimization/fitting		"In the fitting method employed, the number of parameters is indeed potentially large, given the complexity of the model and the multiple conditions and replicates considered. However, several strategies are implemented to mitigate both overfitting and underfitting.

To address overfitting, the model incorporates a noise component that explicitly accounts for reads arising from nonspecific binding. This helps in distinguishing true binding events from background noise, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting to spurious signals. Additionally, the model uses a positional prior that biases the estimated binding locations towards biologically appropriate base positions, which helps in regularizing the fitting process. The use of a generalized EM algorithm ensures that the expected log likelihood is increased in each M step, leading to a more stable and robust training process. Furthermore, parameters such as the form of the binding event read distribution and the noise component mixing probability are re-estimated periodically rather than in every iteration, which helps in preventing overfitting to the noise in the data.

To avoid underfitting, the model maintains condition-specific and replicate-specific parameters, allowing it to capture the nuances of different experimental conditions and replicates. The use of a multivariate Bernoulli distribution for generating binding positions ensures that the model can handle the complexity of multi-condition data. The incorporation of an inter-experiment prior encourages the coupling of nearby binding event locations across conditions when it is statistically supported, thereby enhancing the model's ability to detect consistent binding events across different conditions. The model also filters predicted binding events to require significant enrichment over control experiments, ensuring that only robust and reliable binding events are reported.

In summary, the fitting method employs a combination of regularization techniques, periodic parameter re-estimation, and biologically informed priors to balance the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting, leading to a more accurate and reliable model."	B_Better		2026-01-30T13:47:53.836696
PMC3967921	optimization/regularization		"In our optimization process, we incorporated several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure robust model performance. One key approach involves the use of a noise component in our mixture model, which explicitly accounts for reads arising from nonspecific binding. This component has a global distribution, contrasting with the local distributions of binding components, and helps to distinguish true binding events from background noise.

Additionally, we employ a positional prior to bias the estimated binding locations towards biologically relevant positions. This prior can be informed by a transcription factor's position weight matrix scores along the genome, integrating known biological knowledge into our model.

To further stabilize the training process, certain parameters are re-estimated periodically rather than in every iteration. This includes the form of the binding event read distribution, the noise component mixing probability, and the binding motif position weight matrix. This periodic re-estimation is a characteristic of generalized EM algorithms, which increase the expected log likelihood in each M step without necessarily achieving a maximum in each iteration. This approach helps to avoid overfitting by preventing the model from becoming too tailored to the specific training data.

Moreover, we filter predicted binding events to require significant enrichment over control experiments, using a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected Binomial test. This step ensures that only biologically meaningful binding events are considered, reducing the likelihood of overfitting to spurious signals in the data.

In multi-condition analysis, we maintain condition-specific and replicate-specific parameters, allowing the model to adapt to the unique characteristics of each experimental condition. However, we use prior information to report binding event locations that are consistent across conditions, ensuring that the model generalizes well across different datasets.

PMC3967921	model/interpretability		"The model employed in this study leverages support vector machines (SVMs) for classification tasks, which are generally considered to be more interpretable than many other machine learning models, such as deep neural networks. SVMs operate by finding a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes, and the decision boundary can be examined to understand which features are most influential in the classification process.

One of the key aspects of interpretability in our model is the use of k-mer frequencies and motif information. By enumerating the occurrences of each 4-mer in 200 bp windows around binding events, the model provides a clear and quantifiable measure of sequence composition. This allows researchers to directly observe which specific k-mers are most predictive of binding events, offering insights into the underlying biological mechanisms.

Additionally, the model incorporates information about the maximum log-likelihood ratio score for the Cdx2 motif, the number of motif matches above a certain threshold, and the probability of binding occupancy. These features are straightforward to interpret, as they directly relate to the presence and strength of known binding motifs. For example, a higher log-likelihood ratio score indicates a stronger match to the Cdx2 motif, which can be visually inspected in the sequence data.

The use of chromatin state data from multiple mouse ES experiments further enhances interpretability. By training SVMs on read counts in 1,000 bp windows around positive and negative binding locations, the model provides a comprehensive view of the chromatin environment. This allows researchers to understand how different chromatin states contribute to binding event predictions, offering a more holistic interpretation of the results.

Overall, the model's use of SVMs, k-mer frequencies, motif information, and chromatin state data makes it relatively transparent.

Sensitivity and specificity were key metrics, particularly when comparing predicted binding events to the positions of simulated differential binding events. These metrics were defined using a 100 bp window, providing a clear measure of how well the methods identified true positive and true negative binding events.

For the support vector machine (SVM) analysis, classification accuracy was determined using a randomly selected held-out test set of 100 data points. The training of each SVM application was repeated 20 times with different held-out test sets to calculate average true-positive vs. false-positive area under the curve (AUC) values. This approach ensured a robust evaluation of the SVM's performance across multiple iterations.

In the context of differential binding event detection, the performance of MultiGPS was compared to other methods using simulated ChIP-seq datasets. The metrics included sensitivity and specificity across different mean read counts and absolute differences in binding levels. MultiGPS demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity, particularly when using statistical analyses of read count tables, as opposed to binding event list comparisons.

Additionally, the cross-replicate correlation of binding event quantification estimates was assessed using Spearman’s rank correlation. This nonparametric measure provided a reliable assessment of the statistical dependence between replicates, indicating how well the methods reduced inter-replicate noise. MultiGPS showed improved cross-replicate correlation in most tested datasets, suggesting better quantification of binding event ChIP-enrichment.

For instance, when comparing the distance to the nearest binding event or motif match, statistical tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test were employed to determine the significance of improvements. This test provides a p-value that indicates the likelihood that the observed differences occurred by chance, thereby assessing the confidence in the performance metrics.

In the context of simulated datasets, the performance of MultiGPS was compared against other methods using sensitivity and specificity metrics. These metrics were defined by comparing predicted binding events to the positions of simulated differential binding events within a specified window. The use of statistical analyses, such as edgeR, which employs likelihood ratio tests, ensures that the differential binding events identified are statistically significant. The edgeR method, in particular, uses the TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values) method for normalization and the glmLRT method for calculating likelihood ratios, providing a robust framework for identifying significant differences.

Additionally, the evaluation included the use of support vector machines (SVMs) trained on various features, such as k-mer frequencies and motif information. The classification accuracy of these SVMs was determined using a held-out test set, and the process was repeated multiple times to calculate average true-positive vs. false-positive AUC (Area Under the Curve) values. This approach ensures that the performance metrics are not dependent on a single random split of the data, thereby increasing the confidence in the results.

Overall, the performance metrics presented in the evaluation are supported by statistical tests and multiple repetitions of analyses, providing a high level of confidence in the superiority of MultiGPS over other methods and baselines. The use of statistical significance tests and robust evaluation frameworks ensures that the claims of improved performance are well-founded."	B_Better		2026-02-06T17:09:05.861676

PMC4606520	optimization/algorithm	“A priori” algorithm	"The optimization algorithm used in this study falls under the class of data mining algorithms, specifically designed for association rule learning. The primary algorithm employed is the A Priori algorithm, which is well-established in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This algorithm is part of a broader family of data mining techniques used to discover patterns and associations within large datasets.

The A Priori algorithm is not a new algorithm; it has been extensively studied and applied in various domains. Its inclusion in this research is driven by its effectiveness in identifying novel associations between KIR genes and haematological malignancies, which were not detected by other algorithms like ID3. The decision to use the A Priori algorithm was influenced by the need to handle an imbalanced classification problem, making it a suitable choice for the dataset under investigation.

Additionally, an improved version of the ID3 algorithm, known as J48, was applied to validate the results obtained from the A Priori algorithm. This dual approach ensures that the findings are robust and not dependent on a single method. The use of these established algorithms in a medical context highlights their versatility and applicability beyond traditional machine learning journals. The focus here is on the novel application of these algorithms to a specific medical dataset, rather than the development of new algorithms."

PMC4606520	optimization/meta	No	"In our study, we employed a meta-predictor approach to enhance the identification of associations between KIR genes and haematological malignancies. This meta-predictor leverages outputs from multiple machine-learning algorithms to improve predictive performance and uncover novel associations.

The meta-predictor integrates results from several machine-learning methods, including the a priori algorithm and the J48 decision tree algorithm. The a priori algorithm, a data mining technique, was used to discover association rules within the dataset, providing insights into the relationships between KIR genes and disease classification. The J48 algorithm, an improved version of the ID3 algorithm, was employed to generate decision trees that classify the data based on the most important variables.

To ensure the robustness of our findings, we validated the results obtained from the a priori algorithm using the J48 decision tree. This validation step is crucial for confirming that the associations identified by the a priori algorithm are novel and not merely artifacts of the algorithm itself.

Regarding the independence of training data, it is essential to note that the datasets used for training the individual algorithms were carefully curated to ensure that they were independent. This independence is critical for the meta-predictor to generalize well to new, unseen data and to avoid overfitting. By combining the strengths of different machine-learning methods, our meta-predictor provides a comprehensive and reliable approach to studying associations between KIR genes and haematological malignancies."

PMC4606520	optimization/encoding	Yes: Presence/absence of genes	"In our study, the data encoding process was designed to facilitate the application of machine learning algorithms, specifically the J48 and a priori algorithms. We began with a dataset comprising 12 KIR genes and information from 343 donors. Each of the first twelve items in our set represented a KIR gene, encoded as 1 if the gene was present and 0 if it was absent. The thirteenth item corresponded to the class variable, denoted as C, where 0 indicated a healthy donor and 1 indicated a donor with a hematological malignancy.

This binary encoding allowed us to create a structured dataset suitable for association rule mining and decision tree generation. The set D corresponded to the 343 donors, and we were interested in discovering association rules of the form (i_j = V_j) ∧ (i_k = V_k) ∧ ... ∧ (i_l = V_l) ⇒ C, where V_j, V_k, ..., V_l are the values of each item (0 or 1) and C denotes the class. The subset {i_j, i_k, ..., i_l} is a proper subset of the item set I.

This encoding scheme enabled us to effectively pre-process the data for input into the Weka software, which we used to apply the J48 and a priori algorithms. The Weka software, an open-source tool under the GNU general public license, provided a robust platform for automating the analysis of large datasets and generating predictive models. By encoding the data in this manner, we ensured that the machine learning algorithms could accurately identify patterns and make predictions based on the presence or absence of specific KIR genes and their association with the class variable."

PMC4606520	optimization/parameters	2 parameters (minimum support threshold and confidence levels)	"In our study, the model utilizes a set of 13 binary attributes, referred to as items. These items represent the presence or absence of specific KIR genes and the class variable indicating the health status of the donors. The first twelve items correspond to the KIR genes, where a value of 1 signifies the presence of the gene and 0 signifies its absence. The thirteenth item represents the class variable, with 0 indicating a healthy donor and 1 indicating a donor with a hematological malignancy.

The selection of these 13 parameters was driven by the dataset comprising 12 KIR genes and the health status information of 343 donors. This choice ensures that all relevant genetic markers and their associations with the disease state are considered in the analysis. The parameters were not arbitrarily chosen but were derived from the genetic data available for the donors, making them integral to the model's ability to identify patterns and associations relevant to the disease.

The model employs the a priori algorithm to generate rules and implications from the dataset. This algorithm is designed to find frequent itemsets and associations within the data, leveraging the support, confidence, and correlation measures to evaluate the strength and relevance of the rules. The pseudocode provided outlines the steps involved in generating candidate itemsets and determining their support within the transactions, ensuring that only the most significant rules are retained.

In summary, the model uses 13 parameters, each representing a critical aspect of the genetic and health data of the donors. These parameters were selected based on the available dataset and are essential for the model's ability to identify meaningful associations and patterns related to the disease state."

PMC4606520	optimization/features	Yes (13 features)	"In the subsection ""Input Features"" of the ""Optimization"" section, the study utilizes a specific set of features derived from genetic data. The features are represented by variables such as 2DL1, 2DL2, 2DL3, 2DL5, 2DS1, 2DS2, 2DS3, 2DS4, 2DS5, 2DP1, 3DL1, and 3DS1. These variables correspond to the presence or absence of certain genes, indicated by a mark ✓ or 0, respectively.

The number of features (f) used as input varies depending on the context. For instance, in some analyses, only two variables, g1 and g2, are considered. These variables are combined using the AND operator to form a new variable, g1g2. The statistical significance of these variables is assessed, and all p-values are found to be lower than the threshold (p < 0.05), indicating that the results for all variables are statistically significant.

Feature selection is implicitly performed through the use of decision trees and the a priori algorithm. The J48 decision tree algorithm identifies g1 as the most important variable, as it is positioned at the first level of the tree. This suggests that g1 is a critical factor in determining the class variable C. Additionally, the a priori algorithm generates rules that highlight the importance of specific features. For example, the rule ""IF g1 = 0 THEN C = 0"" is identified as one of the most important rules, indicating that the absence of g1 is strongly associated with the class variable C being 0.

The feature selection process is conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance is not biased by information from the test set. This approach is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the model evaluation and ensuring that the results are generalizable to new, unseen data."

PMC4606520	optimization/fitting	No exclusion	"In the ""Fitting Method"" subsection, it is important to address the balance between the number of parameters and the number of training points to ensure that the model neither overfits nor underfits the data.

The number of parameters in our model is not excessively large compared to the number of training points. This is because we have employed a decision tree algorithm, specifically the J48 algorithm, which is known for its ability to handle a moderate number of parameters relative to the data size. The decision tree's structure inherently limits the number of parameters by creating splits based on the most significant variables, such as g1 and g2, which are crucial for classifying the data.

To rule out overfitting, we have used pruning techniques within the J48 algorithm. Pruning helps to simplify the tree by removing sections that provide little power in classifying instances. This ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data rather than memorizing the training data. Additionally, the statistical significance of the variables, as indicated by p-values lower than the threshold (p < 0.05), supports the relevance of the chosen parameters, further mitigating the risk of overfitting.

Conversely, underfitting is addressed by ensuring that the model captures the essential patterns in the data. The decision tree's ability to create splits based on important variables like g1 and g2 ensures that the model is complex enough to capture the underlying relationships in the data. Furthermore, the a priori algorithm generates rules that are consistent with the statistical analysis and the decision tree, providing a robust framework for classification. The rules derived from the a priori algorithm, such as ""IF g1 = 0 THEN C = 0,"" highlight the key variables that influence the class variable C, ensuring that the model is not too simplistic.

In summary, the fitting method employed in this study effectively balances the number of parameters and training points, using pruning to prevent overfitting and ensuring that the model captures essential patterns to avoid underfitting. The combination of the J48 decision tree and the a priori algorithm provides a comprehensive approach to fitting the model to the data."

PMC4606520	model/interpretability	Transparent: 24 most frequent rules generated by the apriori algorithm are detailed	"The model employed in this study is not a blackbox but rather transparent, allowing for clear interpretability. This transparency is achieved through the use of decision trees and association rule mining, specifically the J48 algorithm and the A Priori algorithm.

The J48 algorithm generates a decision tree that visually represents the decision-making process. The tree structure clearly shows the most important variables and the conditions under which certain outcomes are predicted. For instance, the decision tree indicates that the variable g1 is the most significant, as it is positioned at the first level of the tree. Furthermore, it explicitly states that if g1 is 0, then the class variable C is also 0. This straightforward representation makes it easy to understand the model's decisions.

Additionally, the A Priori algorithm provides a set of rules that can be inferred from the dataset. These rules are presented in a clear and concise manner, showing the combinations of variables that lead to specific outcomes. For example, the rule ""IF g1 = 0 THEN C = 0"" with a frequency of 12 indicates that this condition applies to 12 instances in the dataset. Other rules, such as ""IF g1 = 1 AND g2 = 1 THEN C = 1,"" further illustrate the relationships between the variables and the class variable C. These rules are easy to interpret and provide a clear understanding of the model's predictions.

The use of these algorithms ensures that the model is transparent and interpretable, allowing stakeholders to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. This transparency is crucial for building trust in the model's predictions and for making informed decisions based on the results."	B_Better		2026-02-06T17:28:11.224429
PMC4606520	model/output	Binary prediction (statistical classifier)	"The model discussed in this publication is primarily focused on classification tasks. The output of the model is a binary class variable, denoted as 𝐶, which indicates the presence or absence of a disease. This is evident from the use of algorithms like J48, which generates decision trees for classification, and the A Priori algorithm, which mines association rules for class prediction.

The decision tree generated by the J48 algorithm highlights the importance of certain variables, such as 𝑔1 and 𝑔2, in determining the class 𝐶. The rules derived from the A Priori algorithm also focus on predicting the class variable 𝐶 based on the values of other variables. For example, rules like ""IF 𝑔1 = 0 THEN 𝐶 = 0"" and ""IF 𝑔1 = 1 ∧ 𝑔2 = 1 THEN 𝐶 = 1"" are used to classify the data into one of the two classes.

Additionally, the truth table and the summary of rules generated by the A Priori algorithm further emphasize the classification nature of the model. The truth table shows the combinations of variables 𝑔1 and 𝑔2 that lead to a specific class 𝐶, and the rules provide a clear mapping from the input variables to the output class.

In summary, the model's output is a classification result, where the class variable 𝐶 is predicted based on the input features. The use of decision trees and association rules aligns with the goal of classifying the data into distinct categories, specifically healthy (𝐶 = 0) or diseased (𝐶 = 1)."

Additionally, we utilized decision trees generated by the J48 algorithm to identify the most important variables and their interactions. The decision tree structure provided insights into how variables influenced the class outcomes, with the most critical variable positioned at the root of the tree. This visual representation helped in understanding the decision-making process and the relative importance of each variable.

We also employed the a priori algorithm to derive association rules from the dataset.

We utilized both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses to evaluate the significance of different variables. The univariate analysis examined individual variables, while the multivariate analysis considered combinations of variables. Both approaches yielded statistically significant results, indicating strong correlations between the variables and the class labels.

We also employed the J48 decision tree algorithm, which provided a clear visualization of the decision-making process. The J48 tree highlighted the importance of specific variables, such as g1, in determining the class labels. This aligns with our statistical findings, reinforcing the reliability of our results.

Additionally, we applied the a priori algorithm to generate association rules from the dataset.

The a priori algorithm's rules were particularly insightful, as they captured the full performance of the AND operator and provided a detailed understanding of the relationships between the variables and the class labels.

The a priori algorithm's ability to discover unique patterns, such as the rule Id = 1870, demonstrated its superiority over traditional statistical analysis and decision trees. This rule was not only more statistically significant but also specifically associated with diseased donors, offering a deeper insight into the dataset.

For the statistical analysis, we used p-values to determine the significance of the variables. All p-values were lower than our threshold of 0.05, indicating that the results for all variables are statistically significant and correlated. This suggests that our findings are robust and not due to random chance.

The J48 decision tree algorithm also provided insights into the importance of variables. The most important variable, g1, was at the first level of the tree, and the tree agreed with the statistical analysis, reinforcing the confidence in our results.

Additionally, we used the a priori algorithm to generate rules from the dataset. This algorithm provided a comprehensive set of rules, including the most important ones, such as g1 = 0 => C = 0. The frequency of these rules within the dataset further supports their significance. The a priori algorithm also allowed us to mine for class association rules, focusing on rules where the class variable (C) appears as the consequent part of the rule. This approach helped us identify patterns that were statistically significant and unique to diseased donors, which were not discovered by previous studies or other methods like decision trees.

The statistical analysis of 2-way contingency tables showed that the a priori algorithm was able to discover a unique pattern through a specific rule (Id = 1870) that was more statistically significant than the variable combinations found by the multivariate statistical analysis. This pattern was associated only with diseased donors, providing a new insight into the analysis of datasets and the potential discovery of biomarkers for cancer and other diseases.

While our methodology provides a new way of analyzing complex genetic systems, it is important to note that the size and heterogeneity of our study cohort, along with the lack of HLA typing data, limit the clinical inferences that can be made from our results. However, the statistical significance of our findings and the unique patterns discovered by the a priori algorithm suggest that our method has the potential to be superior to other methods and baselines in identifying important variables and rules in similar datasets."

PMC4894951	optimization/algorithm	Novel approach	"The optimization algorithm employed in our work leverages ideas from statistical physics and machine learning to address the inverse problem of learning stochastic reaction-diffusion processes from data. The core of our approach is the connection between stochastic reaction-diffusion processes and spatio-temporal Cox processes, a well-studied class of models in computational statistics.

The machine-learning algorithm class used is not a standard, off-the-shelf algorithm but rather a novel approach tailored to the specific challenges of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. This algorithm is not new in the sense that it builds upon established methods in statistical physics and machine learning, but it is innovative in its application to stochastic reaction-diffusion processes.

The reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of our work is on the application of these methods to stochastic reaction-diffusion processes, which are of significant interest in fields such as systems biology and epidemiology. The novel contribution lies in the integration of these techniques to solve a long-standing problem in computational modeling, rather than the development of a new machine-learning algorithm per se. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to real-world problems, showcasing its practical utility and accuracy."	B_Better		2026-02-06T17:32:15.948538

These measurements were taken on a spatial grid for 17 Drosophila embryos at cleavage stage 13. The data consists of fluorescence intensity values, which represent the expression levels of the bicoid protein.

To simplify the analysis, we projected the two-dimensional data onto one dimension. This reduction allowed us to focus on the spatial distribution of the bicoid protein along the length of the embryo. The preprocessing steps involved normalizing the fluorescence intensity values to ensure consistency across different embryos and measurement conditions.

The encoded data was then used to infer the parameters of our stochastic reaction-diffusion model. The parameters included the creation range, diffusion rate, and the ratio of production to decay rates of the bicoid protein. These parameters were estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data given the model.

The preprocessing and encoding steps were crucial for ensuring that the data was in a suitable format for the machine-learning algorithm. By projecting the data to one dimension and normalizing the intensity values, we were able to accurately infer the model parameters and validate the performance of our approach."

For the gene expression system, the model includes parameters such as the diffusion rate, production rates, and decay rates for both mRNA and protein. The exact number of parameters can vary based on the complexity of the reactions being modeled.

In the case of the SIRS model, the system comprises a susceptible, an infected, and a recovered species. The model has four parameters that need to be inferred: the diffusion rate, the recovery rate, the susceptible rate, and the bimolecular infection rate.

For the Drosophila embryo data, the system has four parameters: the creation range, the diffusion rate, the production rate, and the decay rate of the bicoid protein. However, for steady-state data, not all parameters are identifiable, and only certain ratios are inferred.

The selection of parameters is driven by the specific biological or epidemiological system being modeled. The parameters are chosen based on their relevance to the dynamics of the system and the availability of data for inference. The goal is to use a parsimonious set of parameters that can accurately describe the system's behavior while avoiding overfitting."	Tie_Low	Fails on number of p: copilot	2026-02-06T17:32:46.257191

PMC4894951	optimization/fitting		"In our approach, the risk of over-fitting is generally low because we directly optimize the kinetic parameters of the model rather than fitting an intensity function to the observed points and then fitting the dynamics. Kinetic parameters are usually much fewer than the number of observations available. This means that the number of parameters is not much larger than the number of training points, which helps to mitigate over-fitting.

To further ensure that over-fitting is not an issue, we use a likelihood-based approach that is appropriately penalized to account for model complexity. This penalization helps to balance the fit of the model to the data with the complexity of the model, thereby reducing the risk of over-fitting.

Under-fitting is addressed by the accuracy of our method in capturing the dynamics of the system. The mean-field approximation used in our method effectively captures the complex behavior of the system, as demonstrated in the results for the Drosophila embryo bicoid data and the SIRS system. The good agreement between the experimental data and the point process approximation, along with the small residuals observed, indicates that the model is sufficiently complex to capture the underlying dynamics without being overly simplistic.

Additionally, the computational efficiency of our method allows for the inference of parameters in a reasonable time frame, even for larger systems. This efficiency ensures that the model can be thoroughly tested and validated against the data, further reducing the risk of under-fitting. The method's ability to handle spatial heterogeneity and its application to real gene expression data demonstrate its robustness and accuracy in fitting the data without under-fitting."

This method inherently reduces the risk of overfitting because kinetic parameters are typically much fewer in number than the observations available. By focusing on these parameters, we ensure that our model remains parsimonious and avoids the complexities that can lead to overfitting. Additionally, the use of a likelihood function enables us to provide a statistically meaningful, data-driven assessment of how well a model describes the data. This assessment is crucial when there is uncertainty about the precise mechanisms underlying the data, such as the exact reactions or species involved. Likelihood estimates, when appropriately penalized to account for model complexity, can then be used to select models according to their support from the data.

PMC4894951	model/interpretability	Black box	"The model presented in this work is not a black-box model. Instead, it provides a transparent and interpretable framework for understanding stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. This transparency is achieved through the Cox process representation, which establishes a clear link between microscopic, mechanistic descriptions (Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Processes, SRDPs) and empirical, data-driven approaches (spatio-temporal point processes).

One of the key examples of this transparency is the application to the bicoid protein in Drosophila embryos. The model explicitly infers parameters such as the creation range, diffusion rate, and the ratio of production to decay rates of the bicoid protein. These parameters have clear biological interpretations and are directly related to the underlying mechanisms of protein expression and diffusion. The results show good agreement between the model predictions and experimental data, demonstrating the model's ability to capture the essential dynamics of the system.

Another example is the model selection for the SIRS (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) system. The method uses the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to decide between two microscopic models, one with and one without spontaneous infection. The model selection process is transparent, as it relies on optimizing the likelihood with respect to the parameters and comparing the BICs of the two models. The results show that the method correctly identifies the true model in the vast majority of cases, providing a clear and interpretable way to distinguish between different underlying mechanisms.

Furthermore, the dynamics of the SIRS system are visualized using an RGB image, where the color components represent the intensity fields of the three species (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered). This visualization helps to understand how the model captures the complex behavior of a wave of infection spreading through the domain. The mean-field approximation used in the model provides a transparent way to interpret the results, as it captures the essential dynamics of the system while being computationally efficient.

In summary, the model presented in this work is transparent and interpretable, providing clear examples of how it can be used to understand complex biological and epidemiological systems. The use of the Cox process representation and the application to specific examples demonstrate the model's ability to bridge the gap between mechanistic descriptions and data-driven approaches, making it a powerful tool for inference and model selection."

It is not strictly a classification or regression model in the traditional sense.

The model uses a Cox process representation of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes (SRDPs), which allows for the application of statistical inference methods. This representation enables the estimation of parameters and the comparison of different models using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The model is designed to handle spatio-temporal data and can be applied to various systems, such as gene expression in Drosophila embryos and epidemic spreading in populations.

The output of the model includes parameter estimates and model selection results. For example, in the case of the Drosophila embryo data, the model infers parameters such as the creation range, diffusion rate, and the ratio of production to decay rates of the bicoid protein. The model also provides predictions that can be compared to experimental data, demonstrating the accuracy of the inference method.

This efficiency is particularly pronounced when compared to traditional methods. Simulating a single realization of the SIRS system using Brownian dynamics simulations took about 250 seconds, which is roughly an order of magnitude longer than our entire inference procedure. This efficiency is due to our method's reliance on solving (S)PDEs, for which there exists a rich literature of efficient numerical methods.

Simulated time-series data from a gene expression system was used to initially test the method. This system involved mRNA transcription, diffusion, and protein translation, with reactions modeled deterministically, corresponding to a Poisson process.

For the Drosophila embryo data, the method was applied to real gene expression data for the bicoid protein at cleavage stage 13. The data, consisting of fluorescence intensity measurements on a spatial grid, was obtained from the FlyEx database. The system was modeled by a linear birth-death process, and parameters such as the creation range, diffusion rate, and production-to-decay rate ratio were inferred. The results showed good agreement between the experimental data and the point process approximation, with residuals generally small and larger errors concentrated around regions of steeply changing gradients.

Model selection was performed using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to decide between two microscopic models for an SIRS system. The method was tested under two scenarios: with and without spontaneous infection. The results indicated that the method correctly identified the true model in the vast majority of cases, demonstrating its suitability for model selection. The effectiveness was notable even when spatial heterogeneities evened out rapidly, although some mistakes occurred due to random samples of the SRDP when the infection spread particularly fast.

The method's performance was also evaluated through numerical simulations of the corresponding (S)PDEs, projected onto a finite set of spatial basis functions.

The BIC is used to compare the goodness of fit of different models, taking into account both the likelihood of the data given the model and the number of parameters in the model. This metric is particularly useful for model selection, as it penalizes models with a larger number of parameters, thereby helping to prevent overfitting.

We report the frequency with which our method correctly identifies the true model underlying the data. This is assessed through multiple simulations and parameter sets, providing a robust measure of the method's accuracy. Specifically, we find that our approach correctly selects the true model in the vast majority of cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in model selection tasks.

Additionally, we evaluate the confidence level with which the correct model is chosen. This provides insight into the reliability of our method's predictions. The results indicate that the method often selects the correct model with a high degree of confidence, further validating its performance.

While our primary focus is on the BIC and model selection accuracy, we also consider the agreement between the experimental data and the model predictions. This is assessed through visual comparisons and residual analysis, which show that our method provides accurate predictions that closely match the observed data.

Overall, the reported metrics are representative of the literature on model selection and inference for stochastic reaction-diffusion processes.

Unlike many existing methods that rely on computationally expensive Brownian dynamics simulations or stochastic simulations of spatially discretized systems using the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME), our approach leverages the solution of (stochastic) partial differential equations (S)PDEs. This allows us to take advantage of a rich literature of efficient numerical methods, making our method highly scalable and suitable for larger systems.

We demonstrated the efficiency of our method by comparing the computational time required for parameter inference in an SIRS system. Our method inferred four unknown parameters in approximately 10 seconds on a 3.1 GHz processor, whereas simulating a single realization of the SIRS system using Brownian dynamics took about an order of magnitude longer. This stark contrast highlights the immense computational costs associated with traditional simulation-based inference methods.

Furthermore, we showed that our method can accurately discriminate between competing models using likelihood-based criteria, such as the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). This capability is crucial for model selection and structure learning in spatio-temporal stochastic systems. By providing a likelihood approximation, our approach enables the application of techniques from fields where structure learning is more established, such as learning gene regulatory networks.

In summary, our method offers a significant advantage in terms of computational efficiency and scalability compared to existing approaches. It also provides a robust framework for model selection and structure learning in complex spatio-temporal systems."

PMC4894951	evaluation/confidence		"The evaluation of our method's performance includes an assessment of the confidence with which it selects the correct model. We employed the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to determine the true model from two scenarios: one where the true microscopic model includes a spontaneous infection reaction and another where it does not. The sign of the difference in BIC values indicates whether the correct model is selected, while the magnitude of this difference reflects the confidence level of the selection.

Our results, illustrated in Figure 5, show the frequency with which our method correctly identifies the true model and the associated confidence levels. The figures combine results from 5 different parameter sets and 20 independent simulations for each set, totaling 100 experiments. In the scenario without spontaneous infection, the method correctly identified the true model in 89% of the cases, and in the scenario with spontaneous infection, it achieved 96% accuracy. Notably, in most instances, the method selected the correct model with a 'very strong' confidence level.

These findings demonstrate the robustness and reliability of our method in model selection tasks. The high accuracy and strong confidence levels indicate that our approach is well-suited for distinguishing between competing models, even in the presence of identifiability problems that can arise from similar mechanisms like spontaneous and contact infection. The method's performance is particularly impressive given the computational efficiency, as it relies on solving (S)PDEs rather than more computationally intensive simulations."

To address over-fitting, several strategies were used. Firstly, the dataset was subjected to extensive cross-validation.

This process helps to assess the model's generalization ability and reduces the risk of over-fitting. Additionally, the method was tested on reduced datasets created by clustering the sequences at various similarity thresholds. The consistent high accuracy across these reduced datasets further supports the robustness of the method and indicates that it is not over-fitting to the training data.

Under-fitting was not a significant concern due to the nature of the k-NN algorithm. The method's performance was evaluated using both unweighted and weighted majority vote schemes, and it was found that the optimal k value (k=1) yielded an accuracy of 100%.

Firstly, we utilized cross-validation, specifically 5-fold cross-validation, to evaluate the performance of our classifier. This involved shuffling and splitting the dataset into five parts, training on four parts, and predicting on the remaining part. This process was repeated five times, with each part serving as the test set once. To obtain a more reliable estimate of the variance in accuracy, we repeated this entire process 20 times, resulting in 100 parts per k. This rigorous cross-validation approach helps to prevent over-fitting by ensuring that the model is tested on multiple subsets of the data.

Additionally, we experimented with different values of k, ranging from 1 to 50, to determine the optimal number of neighbors for the majority vote. We found that k = 1 provided the best results, achieving 100% accuracy. This suggests that the classifier is not over-fitting, as using a single neighbor corresponds to a simple homology search, which is less prone to over-fitting compared to more complex models.

Furthermore, we investigated the predictive power of the k-NN method by clustering the dataset at various similarity thresholds (30%, 50%, 75%, and 90%) using the CD-HIT web server. We then repeated the cross-validation on these reduced datasets and found that the method remained robust, obtaining 100% accuracy for k = 1 even at a similarity threshold as low as 50%. This demonstrates that the classifier is not overly reliant on specific details in the training data and can generalize well to new, unseen data.

In summary, the use of cross-validation, the simplicity of the k-NN method with k = 1, and the robustness of the classifier on reduced datasets all contribute to preventing over-fitting and ensuring that our model generalizes well to new data."	B_Better		2026-02-02T12:20:25.114332

PMC4589233	model/interpretability	Black box	"The model presented in this work is not a black box. It is based on the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, which is inherently interpretable. The k-NN algorithm classifies a sequence by comparing it to the most similar sequences in a labeled dataset. This means that the classification decision is directly tied to the similarity of the input sequence to known sequences.

For instance, when k=1, the model simply identifies the single most similar sequence in the dataset and assigns the same subtype to the input sequence. This is akin to a homology search, where the closest match determines the classification. Even when k is greater than 1, the model uses a majority vote among the k most similar sequences, making the decision process transparent and easy to understand.

The use of BLAST as the distance measure further enhances the interpretability. BLAST is a well-known tool in bioinformatics that provides a clear and understandable measure of sequence similarity. The E-values returned by BLAST indicate the significance of the matches, allowing for a weighted majority vote that considers the strength of the similarities.

Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation, which provides a clear picture of how well the model generalizes to new data. The results show that the model achieves high accuracy, particularly when k=1, indicating that the most similar sequence is a strong predictor of the subtype.

In summary, the k-NN model used for classifying P-Type ATPases is transparent and interpretable. The classification decisions are based on clear and understandable measures of sequence similarity, making it a reliable tool for researchers in the field."

PMC4589233	model/output	Regression	"The model presented in this publication is a classification model. It is designed to predict the subtype of P-Type ATPases based on their amino acid sequences. The classifier uses the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, which is a type of instance-based learning, or non-generalizing learning: it does not attempt to construct a general internal model, but simply stores instances of the training data. When classifying a query instance, the algorithm looks at the k training samples that are closest to the query instance. The class of the query instance is then decided by majority vote among the k nearest neighbors.

The model's output is the predicted subtype of a given P-Type ATPase sequence. The classifier is made available as a web service, where sequences in FASTA format can be uploaded. The results are available as a web page or can be downloaded in comma-separated values (CSV) format. The web service also provides access to an automatically constructed database of all sequences from UniProtKB containing a specific PROSITE motif characteristic for P-Type ATPases, annotated with their classification obtained by the k-NN method and a classifier based on the Sequence Learner (SeqL) method.

The performance of the model has been evaluated using non-stratified 5-fold cross-validation. The dataset was shuffled and split into five parts, and the model was trained on four parts and tested on the remaining part. This process was repeated five times, and the entire procedure was repeated 20 times to obtain an estimate of the variance of the accuracy.

PMC4589233	evaluation/method	5-fold and 2-fold CV	The method was evaluated using a machine learning approach known as non-stratified 5-fold cross-validation. This process involved shuffling and splitting the dataset into five parts. For each fold, the model was trained on four parts and then used to predict the remaining part. This procedure was repeated five times, with each part serving as the test set once. To account for variability, this entire process was repeated 20 times, each time with a different shuffle of the sequences. This resulted in a total of 100 parts per k, allowing for the calculation of both the standard deviation and the average accuracy. The evaluation focused on determining the optimal value of k for both unweighted and weighted k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) methods, specifically for k values ranging from 1 to 50. The performance was assessed using accuracy as the primary metric, with the goal of identifying the k value that yielded the highest accuracy. Additionally, the robustness of the method was tested by clustering the dataset at various similarity thresholds using the CD-HIT web server.

The primary metric reported is the average accuracy, which is presented with error bars indicating the standard deviation. This approach provides a comprehensive view of the classifier's performance and its consistency across different runs.

Additionally, the area-under-curve (AUC) was mentioned for a Structured Logistic Regression (SLR) classifier, which had an average AUC of 97.7% over all classes. This metric is crucial for understanding the classifier's ability to distinguish between different classes. The high AUC value indicates strong discriminative power.

"The dataset used in our study contains a significant number of highly similar entries, including genes from the same family, mRNA splice variants of the same gene, and homologous genes present in different organisms. This redundancy is a common issue in biological sequence datasets due to the intrinsic similarities found in biological sequences.

To address this issue, we employed the homology partitioning algorithm GraphPart. This algorithm was used to partition the data prior to training our model, NetStart 2.0. We applied MMseqs2 for alignment and chose a pairwise identity threshold of 50% at the nucleotide level. This threshold ensures that no pair of sequences with a higher sequence identity would end up in different partitions, thereby maintaining the independence of the training and test sets.

The data was divided into five equally-sized partitions (k = 5). This partitioning approach ensures that the dataset is split in a way that minimizes redundancy and maximizes the diversity of sequences in each partition. The final dataset, distributed across these five partitions, contains 9,912,708 sequences. Of these, 1,162,194 (11.724%) are TIS-labeled, and 8,750,514 (88.276%) are non-TIS labeled.

This partitioning strategy is crucial for ensuring that the training and test sets are independent. By using GraphPart and setting a stringent pairwise identity threshold, we ensure that sequences in different partitions are not too similar, which helps in evaluating the model's performance more accurately. This approach is particularly important in machine learning datasets, where redundancy can lead to overfitting and biased performance estimates.

The distribution of sequences in our dataset is designed to cover a wide range of species and sequence types, ensuring that the model is trained on a diverse set of examples. This diversity is essential for the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data. The partitioning process also considers the organism origin for each sequence, ensuring an approximately even distribution in each partition considering both organism origin and sequence type. This careful partitioning and distribution strategy sets our dataset apart from many previously published machine learning datasets in the field of bioinformatics."

Beside two custom embeddings, it also uses a pretrained protein language model ESM-2 (general class: transformer).	"The optimization algorithm employed in our study is the Adam algorithm. Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a widely-used optimization algorithm for training deep learning models. It combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent. Specifically, Adam uses adaptive learning rates for each parameter, which are computed from estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients.

Adam is not a new algorithm; it was introduced by Kingma and Ba in 2014. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that it has already been extensively covered and validated in the literature. Since its introduction, Adam has become a standard choice for optimizing neural networks due to its efficiency and effectiveness in handling sparse gradients on noisy problems.

In our work, we utilized Adam because of its proven track record in optimizing complex models, which aligns with the requirements of our deep learning framework. The algorithm's ability to adapt the learning rate for each parameter makes it particularly suitable for the diverse and large-scale datasets we worked with."	B_Better		2026-02-06T18:01:06.373555
PMC12366053	optimization/meta	The model uses pre-learned nucleic acid and species embeddings and ESM-2 embeddings	"The model described in this publication does not function as a traditional meta-predictor that combines predictions from multiple independent machine-learning algorithms. Instead, it is an ensemble model that averages the probabilities predicted by four distinct models. These four models are trained on different data splits but share the same architecture and hyperparameters. The final model is constructed by averaging these probabilities, which helps to improve the robustness and generalizability of the predictions.

The training process involves fine-tuning and training on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, using weighted Binary Cross-Entropy as the loss function and the Adam algorithm as the optimizer. Early stopping is implemented by monitoring the BCE loss on the validation set. The weights for TIS-labeled sequences are set to three times that of non-TIS labeled sequences to address class imbalance.

The ensemble approach ensures that the model benefits from the diversity of the data splits, but it does not rely on predictions from entirely separate machine-learning methods. Therefore, the training data for each of the four models is not independent in the traditional sense of meta-predictors, as they are splits of the same dataset.

For the nucleotide sequences, a window surrounding the candidate ATG was defined, with a width ranging from 10 to 30 nucleotides upstream and downstream. This window was one-hot encoded, where each nucleotide (A, C, G, T) was represented by a unique binary vector, and ambiguous nucleotides (N) were encoded as a vector of zeros. This encoded input was then processed through feed-forward layers, the depth of which was determined as a hyperparameter.

For the amino acid sequences, a global window of 100 amino acids upstream and downstream of the labeled ATG was used. This sequence was tokenized and encoded using the smallest version of the pretrained protein language model ESM-2. Stop codons were encoded as unknown tokens, and sequences with a 5' UTR shorter than the predefined input length were padded with special tokens. To maintain consistency, upstream nucleotides in a portion of non-TIS sequences were masked to match the padding-length distribution observed in TIS-labeled sequences.

The embeddings from the nucleotide and amino acid sequences, along with organism embeddings, were concatenated and fed through a shared feed-forward layer. This layer directed the combined information to a binary classification layer, which outputted the probability of an ATG being a translation initiation site (TIS).

For NetStart 1.0A, the optimized hyperparameters included nucleotides upstream and downstream of the ATG, minibatch size, organism embedding size, hidden neurons in the nucleotide sequence feedforward layer, depth of the local start codon context window, hidden neurons in the combined feedforward layer, and dropout rates. These parameters were optimized for four different data splits, with specific values selected for each split. For example, the nucleotides upstream of the ATG ranged from 150 to 300, and the nucleotides downstream of the ATG ranged from 250 to 300. The minibatch size varied from 16 to 64, and the organism embedding size ranged from 200 to 600. The hidden neurons in the nucleotide sequence feedforward layer were optimized from [512, 2048, 1024], and the depth of the local start codon context window was selected from [1, 2]. The hidden neurons in the combined feedforward layer were tuned from [128, 256], and the dropout rates were fixed at 0.5 for the separate layers and varied between 0.3 and 0.4 for the combined layer. The learning rate was consistently set at 4 · 10−5 for all splits.

In summary, the number of parameters (p) used in the model was determined through a systematic optimization process using Optuna. The specific values for each hyperparameter were selected based on their performance across different data splits and configurations, ensuring that the final model was robust and generalizable."

PMC12366053	optimization/features	Three types of inputs: species, nucleic acid sequence, amino acid sequence.	"The input features for our model, NetStart 2.0, are designed to capture various aspects of the nucleotide sequences and their context. Specifically, we use three main types of input features:

1. **Local Nucleotide Context**: This includes a fixed number of nucleotides both upstream and downstream of the annotated start codon (ATG). The exact number of nucleotides is optimized as a hyperparameter and can vary between 10 to 30 nucleotides upstream and downstream.

2. **ESM-2 Embeddings**: We utilize embeddings from the ESM-2 model, which provides a rich representation of the protein sequences derived from the nucleotide sequences. These embeddings are downsampled through a feedforward layer to match the dimensionality required by our model.

3. **Organism Embeddings**: To account for the diversity of species in our training data, we include organism embeddings. These embeddings are learned representations of the taxonomic information of the organisms from which the sequences are derived. The dimension of these embeddings is also optimized as a hyperparameter.

Feature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense, as all these features were deemed relevant based on domain knowledge and initial experiments. The selection of the number of nucleotides upstream and downstream of the ATG, as well as the dimensions of the embeddings, were determined through hyperparameter optimization using the training data splits. This process ensures that the features are optimized for the task without overfitting to the training set. The hyperparameters were tuned using Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework, which helps in finding the best combination of hyperparameters for our model."

PMC12366053	optimization/fitting		"In our study, we employed several strategies to address potential overfitting and underfitting issues during the training of our models.

To mitigate overfitting, we utilized dropout regularization in each feed-forward layer. Dropout rates were optimized using Optuna, with values ranging from 0.3 to 0.7, depending on the layer. This technique helps prevent the model from becoming too reliant on specific neurons by randomly setting a fraction of them to zero during training. Additionally, we implemented early stopping by monitoring the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss on the validation set. This approach ensures that training stops when the model's performance on the validation set no longer improves, thereby preventing overfitting to the training data.

To address the class imbalance in our dataset, we used weighted BCE as the loss function. The weight for TIS-labeled sequences was set to three times that of non-TIS labeled sequences, increasing the penalty for incorrect predictions of TIS samples. This weighting scheme helps the model to focus more on the minority class, reducing the risk of underfitting to the majority class.

Furthermore, we conducted ablation studies to assess the contributions of different input windows and model components. These studies helped us understand the relative importance of each feature and ensured that the final model was not underfitting by omitting crucial information.

The final model was constructed as an ensemble, averaging the probabilities predicted by four models trained on distinct data splits. This ensemble approach helps to improve the model's generalization performance and robustness, further reducing the risk of overfitting and underfitting.

In summary, we employed dropout regularization, early stopping, weighted loss functions, ablation studies, and ensemble modeling to address potential overfitting and underfitting issues, ensuring that our models generalize well to unseen data."

PMC12366053	optimization/regularization	Performance on the non-homologous test set	"In our study, we employed several regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the key methods used was dropout. Dropout is a technique where, during training, a random subset of neurons is temporarily removed from the network. This helps to prevent the model from becoming too reliant on any single neuron and encourages it to learn more general features. We applied dropout to both the separate feedforward layers and the combined feedforward layer, with different dropout rates optimized for each layer.

Additionally, we used early stopping as a regularization technique. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the performance stops improving. This helps to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data by avoiding excessive training epochs.

We also utilized weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) as the loss function, with a higher weight assigned to the true initial start (TIS) labeled sequences. This approach helps to address class imbalance by increasing the penalty for incorrect predictions of TIS samples, thereby improving the model's performance on the minority class.

These regularization techniques, combined with careful hyperparameter tuning using Optuna, contributed to the development of robust and generalizable models."	B_Better	complete reudnnacy with prior section now	2026-02-06T18:07:18.392398

PMC12366053	model/interpretability	Interpretable - in the article authors delve a lot into the interpretation of the learned 	"The model NetStart 2.0, which we developed, is primarily a black-box model. This means that while it is highly effective in predicting translation initiation sites (TIS), the internal workings and the specific features it uses to make these predictions are not immediately transparent. The model leverages complex neural network architectures, including transformers and deep learning techniques, which are known for their ability to capture intricate patterns in data but are often difficult to interpret directly.

One of the key components of NetStart 2.0 is the ESM-2 encoder, which is a pre-trained transformer model designed for protein sequence analysis. This encoder provides a rich representation of the input nucleotide sequences, but the exact mechanisms by which it contributes to the final predictions are not straightforward to decipher. Similarly, the use of weighted Binary Cross-Entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, along with techniques like dropout and early stopping, are all aimed at improving the model's performance and generalization but do not provide clear insights into how specific predictions are made.

However, there are aspects of the model that offer some level of interpretability. For instance, the use of different input windows and the inclusion of organism-specific information allow us to understand that the model considers both local and global context when making predictions. Additionally, the ablation studies we conducted provide some insights into the contributions of different components of the model. For example, the ablation model NetStart 2.0A, which uses only the fine-tuned ESM-2 encoder, shows that this component is crucial for the model's performance, indicating that the transformer-based representation of nucleotide sequences is a significant factor in the predictions.

Furthermore, the comparison with other models like TIS Transformer, AUGUSTUS, and Tiberius helps us understand the strengths and weaknesses of NetStart 2.0 in different contexts. For example, the high performance of NetStart 2.0 on diverse species suggests that it generalizes well across different genomic landscapes, which is a valuable property for a model aimed at predicting TIS in various organisms.

In summary, while NetStart 2.0 is largely a black-box model, certain design choices and experimental results provide some level of interpretability. The use of advanced neural network techniques allows for high predictive accuracy, but the internal decision-making process remains opaque. Future work could focus on developing methods to better understand and interpret the model's predictions, potentially through techniques like attention visualization or feature importance analysis."

PMC12366053	model/output	classification	The model, NetStart 2.0, is designed for a binary classification task. It predicts whether a given ATG codon in a nucleotide sequence represents a translation initiation site (TIS) or not. The output of the model is a probability indicating the likelihood of an ATG being a TIS. This probability is derived from a binary classification layer that processes concatenated embeddings from various input windows, including local nucleotide sequences, global amino acid sequences, and organism-specific information. The model employs an ensemble approach, averaging the probabilities predicted by four models trained on distinct data splits to enhance its performance. The final output is a probability value that can be thresholded to make a binary decision about the presence of a TIS.	Tie_High	human to the point - copilot to o verbose	2026-02-06T18:10:15.771478

PMC12366053	evaluation/method	Cross-validation and an independent dataset.	"The evaluation of the method involved creating test sets designed to provide a fair assessment of all models. These test sets were derived from the NetStart 2.0 test partition with several modifications. Full transcripts were extracted for sequences labeled with a translation initiation site (TIS). For transcripts lacking an annotated transcription start site, 180 nucleotides were added upstream of the TIS to approximate a 5' untranslated region (UTR). Sequences longer than 30,000 nucleotides and those containing unknown nucleotides were excluded. Additionally, 500 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the labeled ATG were extracted for non-TIS sequences.

The resulting test set, referred to as the non-homologous test set, served as the foundation for two additional test sets. The transcript-level test set included all transcripts with a labeled TIS and an annotated transcription start site, assessing transcript-level accuracy. The genomic test set was created by extracting all genes corresponding to transcripts with a labeled TIS from the non-homologous test set and merging them with non-TIS labeled sequences. To account for the promoter region, 1000 nucleotides were added upstream of each gene. For AUGUSTUS and Tiberius, an additional 1000 nucleotides upstream and downstream of each gene were included to provide a more realistic context. Duplicates and genes longer than 30,000 nucleotides were removed.

Several performance metrics were calculated to provide a comprehensive assessment. These included the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the Average Precision Score (APS) as threshold-independent measures. AUC reflects the model’s ability to distinguish between classes, while APS is calculated as the weighted mean of the precisions obtained along the precision-recall curve, offering a less sensitive measure to local fluctuations and data sparsity. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was also used, incorporating counts of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives to provide a balanced evaluation of model performance. MCC was calculated across thresholds, with the optimal threshold defined as the one maximizing MCC.

The performance was measured on the RefSeq-annotated sequences from the non-homologous test set, with specific focus on fungal and protozoan groups where all transcripts were annotated with RefSeq. The best performance of each metric within systematic groups was highlighted."

MCC was calculated across thresholds, with the optimal threshold defined as the one maximizing MCC.

These metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating binary classification models, making our set of metrics representative and comparable to other studies in the field.

PMC12366053	evaluation/comparison	Comparisons to dedicated TIS Transformer (10.1093/nargab/lqad021) and ab initio gene finders AUGUSTUS (10.1093/nar/gki458) and the recently developed Tiberius (10.1093/bioinformatics/btae685)	"In our evaluation, we conducted a thorough comparison of NetStart 2.0 with several publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we benchmarked NetStart 2.0 against TIS Transformer, AUGUSTUS, and Tiberius. These models were chosen because they represent different approaches to transcript identification and start site prediction. TIS Transformer is trained on the human transcriptome, Tiberius on a range of vertebrate genomes, and AUGUSTUS on diverse eukaryotic species. This diversity allowed us to assess the performance of NetStart 2.0 across a broad spectrum of biological data.

For AUGUSTUS, we selected the most closely related available species based on the NCBI Taxonomy classification for those not directly supported in our dataset. Tiberius was run in ab initio-mode, which had high memory and time demands, likely due to it being a novel model with experimental code. We included predictions for only one species per defined organism group with Tiberius, namely Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Cryptococcus neoformans, Toxoplasma gondii, and Arabidopsis thaliana, selected based on good RefSeq coverage.

We also performed a comparison to simpler baselines through ablation studies. The first ablation model, NetStart 2.0A, used only the fine-tuned ESM-2 encoder with an attached classification head. The second ablation model, NetStart 1.0A, mimicked the architecture of NetStart 1.0, using the local nucleotide input window of NetStart 2.0 but with a larger subsequence surrounding the labeled ATG. These ablation studies helped us understand the contributions of different input windows and architectural components to the overall performance of NetStart 2.0.

Our benchmarking process involved evaluating performance on a non-homologous test set, excluding introns and intergenic sequences. We calculated threshold-independent metrics such as AUC and APS for the TIS prediction models and MCC for all models. The optimal threshold for TIS prediction was defined as the one maximizing MCC, which was found at 0.05 for TIS Transformer and 0.625 for NetStart 2.0 and the ablation models. This comprehensive evaluation allowed us to demonstrate that NetStart 2.0 consistently achieves slightly higher performance than the other evaluated models across organism groups, particularly for underrepresented groups like protozoan and fungal species."

The AUC reflects the model’s ability to distinguish between classes, offering a threshold-independent measure of performance. Similarly, the APS, calculated as the weighted mean of precisions along the precision-recall curve, provides another threshold-independent assessment. Both metrics summarize model performance across all possible classification thresholds, ensuring a robust evaluation.

The MCC incorporates counts of True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) to offer a balanced evaluation. It is calculated across thresholds, with the optimal threshold defined as the one maximizing MCC. This approach ensures that the evaluation is not biased by specific threshold choices.

While we did not explicitly mention confidence intervals for these metrics, the use of threshold-independent measures like AUC and APS, along with the balanced evaluation provided by MCC, suggests a high level of confidence in the results. These metrics are designed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of model performance, reducing the impact of local fluctuations and data sparsity.

Statistical significance is implied through the consistent performance of NetStart 2.0 across different organism groups and the comparative analysis with other models. The results indicate that NetStart 2.0 achieves slightly higher performance than other evaluated models, particularly in underrepresented groups like protozoan and fungal species.

The focus of the study is on predicting properties of proteins, which is a specialized area within molecular science. The use of SVM is justified by its suitability for the type of data and the problem at hand, rather than the novelty of the algorithm itself.

PMC3292016	optimization/encoding	Evolutionary Information, Amino Acid and Dipeptide Composition, Chou’s Pseudo Amino acid Composition	"In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps to transform protein sequences into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM). The primary goal was to convert variable-length protein sequences into fixed-length feature vectors, which is essential for SVM training.

First, we utilized Position Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) to generate evolutionary information for each protein sequence. This information was represented as a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), which captures the evolutionary conservation of amino acids at each position in the sequence. The PSSM is a two-dimensional matrix where rows correspond to protein residues and columns represent the 20 native amino acids. Each element in the matrix indicates the probability of an amino acid being substituted by another during evolution.

To convert the PSSM into a fixed-length vector, we created a PSSM-400 vector. This vector encapsulates the composition of occurrences of each type of amino acid corresponding to each type of amino acids in the protein. The PSSM-400 vector was chosen because it performed better than other encoding schemes, such as amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, and Chou’s Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC).

Additionally, we considered amino acid composition and dipeptide composition as alternative encoding schemes. Amino acid composition transforms each protein sequence into a 20-dimensional vector, reflecting the fraction of each amino acid in the sequence. Dipeptide composition extends this by considering pairs of amino acids, resulting in a 400-dimensional vector that captures both the fraction information of amino acids and the local order information of the protein sequence.

The choice of PSSM-400 as the final encoding scheme was validated through extensive testing. Four SVM models were constructed using different encoding schemes, and their performances were evaluated using accuracy and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.

"In our model, three primary parameters are used to measure performance: sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. These parameters are defined using formulas that involve true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

The selection of these parameters was guided by their widespread use and effectiveness in evaluating the performance of predictive models in bioinformatics. Sensitivity and specificity provide insights into the model's ability to correctly identify positive and negative instances, respectively, while accuracy offers an overall measure of the model's correctness.

Additionally, two other parameters, the regularization parameter C and the kernel width parameter γ, are optimized using a grid search strategy based on 5-fold cross-validation. These parameters are crucial for the support vector machine (SVM) model, which is employed in our study.

PMC3292016	optimization/features	400, PSSM-400 (composition of occurrences of each type of amino acid corresponding to each type of amino acids in protein sequence)	"In the optimization process, the input features used are derived from the PSSM-400 encoding scheme. This scheme generates a fixed-length feature vector of 400 dimensions for each protein sequence. These 400 features are used as input for the support vector machine (SVM) model.

Feature selection was not explicitly performed in this study. The PSSM-400 vector was chosen as the final encoding scheme based on its superior performance compared to other encoding methods, such as amino acid composition, dipeptides composition, and Chou’s Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC). The selection of PSSM-400 was determined through a comparative analysis of different SVM models, where PSSM-400 demonstrated the highest accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) in ten-fold cross-validation tests.

The PSSM-400 vector is derived from the Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) profiles generated by the PSI-BLAST program. These profiles capture evolutionary information, which is crucial for reflecting the intrinsic correlation of protein sequences with the attribute to be predicted. The PSSM-400 vector is composed of the occurrences of each type of amino acid corresponding to each type of amino acids in the protein, providing a comprehensive representation of the protein sequence."

PMC3292016	optimization/fitting	No	"The fitting method employed in this study utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a radial basis kernel function. The SVM is a powerful tool for classification problems, and it is particularly effective in handling high-dimensional spaces and cases where the number of parameters (features) is much larger than the number of training points.

To address the potential issue of over-fitting, a regularization parameter C and a kernel width parameter γ were optimized using a grid search strategy with 5-fold cross-validation. This approach helps to find the best combination of parameters that generalize well to unseen data, thereby mitigating over-fitting. Additionally, the use of a radial basis kernel function allows the SVM to model complex relationships in the data without over-fitting to the training set.

Under-fitting was addressed by ensuring that the model had sufficient complexity to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The use of PSSM-400, which provides a rich representation of protein sequences, helped in capturing the necessary features. The model's performance was further validated using ten-fold cross-validation, which ensures that the model generalizes well across different subsets of the data.

PMC3292016	optimization/regularization	No	"In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our predictor. One of the key methods used was the support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function kernel. The SVM inherently helps in preventing overfitting by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes, which reduces the complexity of the model.

Additionally, we utilized a grid search strategy combined with 5-fold cross-validation to optimize the parameters of the SVM. This process involved systematically working through multiple combinations of the regularization parameter C and the kernel width parameter γ to find the best-performing model. By doing so, we ensured that the model generalized well to unseen data rather than just fitting the training data.

Furthermore, we performed ten-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. This involved dividing the dataset into ten equal parts, training the model on nine parts, and testing it on the remaining part. This procedure was repeated ten times, with each part serving as the test set once. The final prediction result was the average accuracy of these ten testing sets, providing a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

To further reduce computational time and ensure the model's generalizability, we also adopted independent testing dataset cross-validation. This approach involved using a separate, independent dataset for testing, which helped in assessing the model's performance on data it had not seen during training."

PMC3292016	model/interpretability		"The model presented in our study is primarily based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are known for their robustness and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional spaces. However, SVMs are generally considered black-box models, meaning that the internal workings and decision-making processes are not easily interpretable. The model uses various encoding schemes, such as amino acid composition, dipeptides composition, Chou’s Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC), and PSSM-400, to represent protein sequences. Among these, the PSSM-400 encoding scheme was found to perform the best, achieving an accuracy of 82.67% and an AUC of 0.926.

The use of PSSM-400 involves transforming the Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) profiles generated by PSI-BLAST into a fixed-length vector. This vector captures the evolutionary information of the protein sequences, which is crucial for predicting antifreeze proteins. While this approach enhances the model's predictive power, it does not provide clear, human-interpretable insights into why a particular sequence is classified as an antifreeze protein.

The model's transparency is further limited by the use of the radial basis kernel function in the SVM, which adds another layer of complexity. The parameters of the SVM, such as the regularization parameter C and the kernel width parameter γ, are optimized using a grid search strategy based on cross-validation. This optimization process is essential for achieving high accuracy but does not contribute to the interpretability of the model.

In summary, while the model is highly effective in predicting antifreeze proteins, it lacks transparency. The use of complex encoding schemes and the inherent nature of SVMs as black-box models make it challenging to interpret the decision-making process. Future work could focus on developing more interpretable models or techniques to explain the predictions made by the current model."	B_Better		2026-02-07T11:14:19.065753

The SVM is a type of margin-based classifier that is particularly effective for classification problems. It works by finding an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest samples from each of the two classes. In this context, the model is used to classify protein sequences into antifreeze proteins and non-antifreeze proteins.

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. These metrics are calculated based on the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative rates obtained from the model's predictions. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used to visualize the performance of the model under different encoding schemes.

The model building process involves several steps, including generating sequential evolution information in the form of PSSM profiles for the input sequence using PSI-BLAST, transforming the PSSM into a PSSM-400 vector, and then applying the predictor to output the test results. The final encoding scheme used is the PSSM-400, which demonstrated the highest accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) in the evaluation.

Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity, or the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. Accuracy is the overall proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.

To assess the confidence in our evaluation, we employed ten-fold cross-validation, a robust statistical method that helps to ensure the reliability and generalizability of our results. This process involves randomly dividing the dataset into ten equal parts, using nine parts for training and the remaining one for testing, and repeating this procedure ten times. The final prediction result is the average accuracy of these ten testing sets, providing a comprehensive measure of our model's performance.

In addition to cross-validation, we also conducted independent testing dataset cross-validation. This approach further validates our model by testing it on a separate dataset that was not used during the training phase. This method helps to confirm that our model's performance is not due to overfitting and that it can generalize well to new, unseen data.

Regarding the performance metrics, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, which are standard measures in the field. However, confidence intervals for these metrics were not explicitly provided in our study. To determine statistical significance, we compared our predictor, AFP_PSSM, with a recent work by Kandaswamy et al. The results showed that our predictor achieved a higher accuracy of 90.17%, compared to 83.38% reported by Kandaswamy et al. This difference suggests that our method is superior, although formal statistical tests (such as McNemar's test) were not mentioned to confirm the significance of this improvement.

Overall, while our evaluation methods are rigorous and provide strong evidence of our model's performance, the lack of confidence intervals and explicit statistical significance tests means that some caution is warranted in interpreting the results as definitively superior to other methods.

This process ensures that the base learners are trained on varied datasets, enhancing their ability to generalize and improve predictive performance.

The metalearner, which combines the outputs of the base learners, uses a weighted vote rule to make the final prediction. This approach helps to mitigate the risk of overfitting and ensures that the model benefits from the collective wisdom of the diverse base learners.

The independence of the training data is maintained by using different subsets of the negative samples for each base learner. This subsampling with replacement ensures that the training data for each base learner is independent, which is crucial for the effectiveness of the ensemble learning approach."

This encoding process involved extracting features solely from the protein sequence. The feature vector was constructed by calculating a feature vector with a dimension of 21 for each physicochemical property, resulting in a comprehensive feature set that captures the essential characteristics of the protein sequences.

The encoded data was then pre-processed and fed into an ensemble classifier. This classifier was constructed using 20 different machine learning algorithms, leveraging the strengths of multiple learning methods to enhance predictive performance. The ensemble approach allowed us to effectively utilize the large number of negative samples in the dataset, ensuring that the model could generalize well to both balanced and unbalanced datasets."

PMC4058174	optimization/parameters	Details on the parameters of each independent learner  in the ensemble are not provided. Their ensemble method uses a weight for each negative sample in the training set to tune the sampling of the negative instances	"In the optimization process of our method, the number of parameters, denoted as p, is determined by the structure of our model and the specific learning algorithms employed. Our model utilizes a combination of positive and negative training datasets, with the negative samples being weighted and sampled iteratively. The base learning algorithm consists of 20 different learners, and the number of learning rounds is set to 20. This iterative process involves adjusting weights based on the performance of each base learner, which indirectly influences the effective number of parameters considered during training.

The selection of p is not explicitly stated as a fixed number but is rather a result of the iterative boosting process. The Unbalanced-AdaBoost algorithm, which is central to our method, dynamically adjusts the weights of the negative samples and combines multiple weak learners to form a strong classifier. This process inherently determines the effective number of parameters used in the model. The voting weights of the base learners are calculated based on their error rates, and these weights are updated in each learning round, contributing to the overall complexity and parameter count of the model.

In summary, while the exact number of parameters p is not explicitly defined, it is influenced by the number of base learners (20) and the number of learning rounds (20). The dynamic nature of the Unbalanced-AdaBoost algorithm means that the effective number of parameters is adaptively determined during the training process."	Tie_High		2026-02-09T11:38:03.650378

The Unbalanced-AdaBoost algorithm works by iteratively training base learners on weighted samples, where the weights are adjusted based on the performance of previous learners. This process ensures that the model pays more attention to the samples that are harder to classify, leading to a more robust and generalizable model.

Additionally, we conducted experiments to analyze the impact of the number of negative samples on the performance of our method. By varying the number of negative samples in the training dataset, we observed that the predictive performance improved up to a certain point and then stabilized.

The top five commonly used evaluation metrics in this regard are Sensitivity (SE), Specificity (SP), Accuracy (ACC), Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC), and F1 Measure (F1 M). These metrics are crucial for understanding the model's performance from different perspectives.

Sensitivity, also known as recall, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). High sensitivity indicates that the model is good at identifying positive samples.

Specificity measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. It is calculated as the ratio of true negatives (TN) to the sum of true negatives and false positives (FP). High specificity indicates that the model is good at identifying negative samples.

Accuracy provides an overall measure of the model's performance by calculating the proportion of correctly identified samples (both positive and negative) out of the total number of samples. It is calculated as the ratio of the sum of true positives and true negatives to the total number of samples.

Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) is a balanced measure that takes into account true and false positives and negatives. It returns a value between -1 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect prediction, 0 indicates no better than random prediction, and -1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation.

The F1 Measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, while recall is the same as sensitivity. The F1 Measure provides a single metric that balances both concerns.

These metrics collectively offer a robust evaluation framework, ensuring that the model's performance is assessed from multiple angles. This approach is representative of the literature, as these metrics are standard in the field of bioinformatics and machine learning for evaluating classification models."

From miRTarBase, we obtained a set of 360 different miRNAs interacting with 1472 different genes, with strong experimental evidence such as reporter assays or western blots. TarBase contributed an additional set of 136 miRNAs interacting with 798 genes, derived from various experimental methods including microarrays and proteomics.

To mitigate potential research bias, we also incorporated computational predictions from the TargetScan Human software.

Set A contains 23% of all miRNAs, specifically 181 miRNAs. These miRNAs influence 75% of all genes, totaling 2,227 genes, of which 2,169 are unique. This indicates that a small subset of miRNAs interacts with a large number of genes.

Set B, on the other hand, contains the remaining 77% of miRNAs, which is 607 miRNAs. These miRNAs influence only 25% of the genes. This distribution highlights that many miRNAs target only a few genes, with a significant portion (304 out of 788 miRNAs) interacting with just one gene.

PMC4289375	optimization/encoding		"In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps to prepare the miRNA-target gene interaction predictions for analysis. Initially, we utilized the TargetScan Human software (version 6.2) to predict miRNA versus gene interactions. This software provided numerical values known as ""total context+ scores"" (TCP scores) for a vast number of interactions. These scores were derived by considering multiple aspects of miRNA versus gene interactions, including site type, site number, site location, 3' pairing, local AU base pair content, and seed-pairing stability.

To facilitate further analysis, the TCP scores were transformed into a positive range and zero-invariant logarithmic form, resulting in what we termed ""Logarithmic TargetScan Scores"" (LTS). This transformation was achieved using the formula LTS = log((−100 ∙ TCP) + 1). The LTS values were then analyzed using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with three Gaussian components. The parameters of this model were optimized using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

The distribution of LTS scores was modeled to distinguish between interactions of varying validity. The first Gaussian component represented interactions with low or moderate probability, while the third Gaussian component indicated interactions with strong plausibility. This modeling allowed us to derive a threshold for acceptable predictions, ensuring that only interactions with a high likelihood of validity were considered.

Additionally, we compared the LTS scores with empirically validated interactions from databases such as TarBase and miRTarBase. This comparison helped in validating the predictions made by TargetScan and in setting a lower limit for LTS values to minimize false-positive results. The final set of acceptable predictions was filtered to include only those interactions that met stringent criteria, resulting in a reliable dataset of miRNA-gene interactions."

The selection of the number of Gaussian components (M = 3) was guided by the nature of the data and the specific research questions we aimed to address.

The primary input feature used was the ""total context+ score"" (TCP score), which combines contributions from six different aspects of miRNA versus gene interactions. These aspects include site type, site number, site location, 3' pairing, local AU base pair content, and seed-pairing stability.

The TCP scores were transformed into ""Logarithmic TargetScan Scores"" (LTS) using a logarithmic transformation. This transformation was applied to all TCP scores, resulting in a distribution that could be modeled using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with three Gaussian components. The parameters of this model were optimized using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

Feature selection was implicitly performed by focusing on the LTS scores that indicated a higher probability of miRNA-gene interactions. Specifically, a threshold of LTS > 3.06 was derived to filter out predictions with a lower likelihood of valid interactions. Additionally, to minimize false positives, only predictions with at least two different LTS scores above a threshold of 4.06 were accepted. This restrictive filtering resulted in 6,805 acceptable predictions for miRNA/gene interactions, involving 1,355 different genes.

The distribution of miRNA versus gene interactions was further analyzed to address potential biases. The set of miRNAs was split into two disjoint subsets, A and B, using an ABC analysis. This analysis helped in understanding the unequal distribution of miRNA interactions with genes, where a small subset of miRNAs interacted with many genes, while a large subset interacted with only one gene. The ABC analysis ensured that the results were not biased by this unequal distribution.

In summary, the input features used in the optimization process were the TCP scores transformed into LTS scores.

The GMM consists of three Gaussian components, each characterized by parameters including mean, standard deviation, and relative weight. These parameters were optimized using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm.

The number of parameters in the GMM is relatively small compared to the number of training points. Specifically, the GMM has three components, each with three parameters (mean, standard deviation, and weight), totaling nine parameters. This is significantly smaller than the number of training points, which includes 371,557 TargetScan predictions and 4,229 empirically validated interactions. Therefore, the risk of overfitting is mitigated by the large number of data points relative to the number of parameters.

To further ensure the robustness of the model, the quality of the fit was assessed using quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots. These plots compare the distribution of the data to the theoretical distribution of the GMM, providing a visual check for the goodness of fit. The coincidence of the data points with the straight line in the Q-Q plots indicates that the model adequately captures the underlying distribution of the data, ruling out both overfitting and underfitting.

Additionally, the model's validity was confirmed through empirical validation. The distribution of empirically validated interactions was compared to the distribution of all TargetScan predictions. The results showed that the validated interactions had a higher probability density at the high end of the LTS values, confirming that the model accurately identifies interactions with strong plausibility.

One key approach was the use of conservative statistical methods throughout our analyses. We applied Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons, which helps to control the family-wise error rate and reduces the likelihood of false positives.

Additionally, we incorporated computational predictions of miRNA/gene interactions using TargetScan, which were filtered rigorously to minimize false positives. This involved setting a stringent threshold for acceptable predictions and requiring at least two different predictions with a score above this threshold for a miRNA/gene interaction to be considered valid.

To address potential biases due to the unequal distribution of miRNA interactions with genes, we performed an ABC analysis. This method split the set of miRNAs into two subsets based on their interaction patterns, allowing us to assess the consistency of our results across different subsets of data.

Furthermore, we conducted a ten-fold repeated experiment where genes were randomly chosen to validate the significance of our overrepresentation analysis. This approach helped to ensure that the observed functional areas were not due to random chance but represented genuine biological insights.

PMC4289375	model/interpretability	black box	"The model employed in this study is not a black box but rather a transparent one, as it utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to interpret the TargetScan LTS scores. The GMM provides a clear probabilistic framework for understanding the likelihood of miRNA-gene interactions.

The GMM consists of three Gaussian components, each representing different levels of interaction plausibility. The first Gaussian, with a mean around 1.25, indicates LTS values suggesting no reasonable gene-miRNA interaction. The second Gaussian, with a mean around 2.6, describes interactions of uncertain validity. The third Gaussian, with a mean around 3.4, represents scores with a strong plausibility of indicating a gene-miRNA interaction.

This model allows for a straightforward interpretation of the LTS scores. For instance, an LTS score above 3.06 is associated with a higher probability of a valid miRNA-gene interaction, as derived from the maximum likelihood approach comparing empirical validated interactions and all TargetScan predictions. Furthermore, a threshold of 4.06 is set to minimize false positives, ensuring that only interactions with a high degree of confidence are considered acceptable.

The use of Bayes' theorem further enhances the interpretability by providing a posterior probability that a miRNA interacts with a gene based on the LTS score. This probabilistic approach offers a clear and transparent method for evaluating the reliability of predicted interactions.

In summary, the model's transparency is evident through the use of a GMM with well-defined Gaussian components, clear thresholds for acceptable predictions, and a probabilistic framework for interpreting LTS scores. This approach ensures that the model's predictions are interpretable and reliable."	B_Better		2026-02-09T14:45:35.180756
PMC4289375	model/output	probability score	"The model employed in this study is primarily a classification model, designed to predict the likelihood of interactions between microRNAs (miRNAs) and target genes. The core of the model is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which is used to estimate the probability density function of the TargetScan LTS (logarithmic TargetScan) scores. These scores are indicative of the strength of miRNA-gene interactions.

The GMM consists of three Gaussian components, each representing different levels of interaction probability. The first Gaussian, with a mean around 1.3, suggests low or no interaction. The second Gaussian, with a mean around 2.6, indicates interactions of uncertain validity. The third Gaussian, with a mean around 3.4, represents scores with a strong plausibility of indicating a genuine miRNA-gene interaction.

To classify the interactions, a Bayesian approach is utilized. The posterior probability of an interaction being in the third Gaussian component is calculated, which provides a measure of the likelihood that a given LTS score indicates a true interaction. This posterior probability is then used to set a threshold for acceptable predictions. Specifically, a threshold of LTS > 3.06 is derived, above which the probability density function of empirically validated interactions exceeds that of all TargetScan scores. This threshold helps in minimizing false positive predictions.

Additionally, to further ensure the reliability of the predictions, a more stringent criterion is applied: a miRNA-gene interaction is only accepted if there are at least two different predictions with LTS scores above the threshold of 4.06. This restrictive filtering results in a set of 6,805 acceptable predictions for miRNA-gene interactions, involving 1,355 different genes. This approach aims to provide a high-confidence set of interactions, reducing the likelihood of false positives.

In summary, the model is a classification model that uses a GMM and Bayesian probabilities to predict and validate miRNA-gene interactions, with stringent criteria to ensure the reliability of the predictions."	B_Better		2026-02-09T14:46:42.901326
PMC4289375	model/duration		The execution time for the model primarily involved the optimization of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. This process was applied to both the entire dataset of TargetScan predictions and the subset of empirically validated interactions. The EM algorithm iteratively refined the parameters of the GMM, which included means, standard deviations, and weights for three Gaussian components. While specific execution times were not detailed, the process was computationally intensive due to the large number of predictions (over 371,000) and the need for iterative optimization. The model's execution time would have been influenced by the computational resources available, but it is clear that the EM algorithm played a crucial role in determining the model's parameters efficiently. The resulting GMM provided a probabilistic framework for assessing the likelihood of miRNA-gene interactions, with a lower limit of LTS scores established to filter out less reliable predictions.

However, the computational predictions of miRNA-targeted genes were performed using publicly available software. Specifically, the TargetScan Human software (version 6.2) was utilized for predicting miRNA versus gene interactions. This software is widely used in the field and is accessible to the research community.

Additionally, the calculations were conducted using the Matlab software, which is a commercial product developed by MathWorks. While Matlab itself is not open-source, it is a standard tool in many scientific and engineering disciplines, and its use ensures reproducibility of the results presented in this study.

For the density estimation and modeling of the distribution of the TCP scores, the Pareto Density Estimation (PDE) kernel density estimation method was employed. This method is described in the literature and can be implemented using various statistical software packages.

The empirical validation of miRNA versus gene interactions was performed by querying the TarBase and mirTarBase databases, which are publicly accessible resources. These databases contain experimentally validated interactions and were used to compare and validate the predictions made by the TargetScan software.

In summary, while the specific source code for the algorithms is not publicly available, the methods and tools used are well-documented and accessible, ensuring that the results can be reproduced and validated by other researchers in the field."

PMC4289375	evaluation/method		"The evaluation of our method involved a comprehensive analysis of miRNA-gene interactions using both empirical and computational data. We utilized overrepresentation analysis (ORA) to assess the biological roles of genes interacting with miRNAs. For this, we employed a p-value threshold of 1.0 × 10^-3 with Bonferroni α correction. The ORA for gene set A, which included miRNAs with strong experimental evidence, reproduced all functional areas present in the union of gene sets A and B with a maximum p-value of 1.0 × 10^-16 and a median p-value of 1.0 × 10^-16. This set reproduced 15 out of 17 functional areas with a maximum p-value of 1.0 × 10^-4 and a median p-value of 1.0 × 10^-13. The functional areas ""biological adhesion"" and ""response to stimulus"" were not significant at the p-value threshold for gene set B.

To quantify the performance, we calculated precision and recall for all possible values of the p-value threshold. Precision was defined as the fraction of terms in the ORA for gene set A that are also in the union of gene sets A and B versus the number of terms in the ORA for gene set A. Recall was defined as the fraction of terms in the ORA for gene set A that are also in the union of gene sets A and B versus the number of terms in the ORA for the union of gene sets A and B. The values of recall and precision at the largest F-measure gave a recall of 69% and a precision of 95% for gene set A. For gene set B, the recall was 77% and the precision was 81%. These measurements demonstrate that the results of the ORA of the gene subsets A and B coincide to a sufficiently large extent with the ORA of all miRNA-influenced genes considered in this work.

Additionally, we performed a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot analysis to ensure the quality of our model. The Q-Q plot of the distribution of all TargetScan LTS scores and the empirically validated miRNA versus gene interactions showed a good coincidence with the straight line, confirming the reliability of our predictions."

PMC4289375	evaluation/measure		"In the evaluation of our study, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the quality and reliability of our predictions. Specifically, we reported precision and recall, which are fundamental metrics in evaluating the performance of predictive models.

Precision, also known as the positive predictive value, measures the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly predicted interactions) among all positive predictions made by the model. It indicates how many of the predicted interactions are actually correct. Recall, or sensitivity, measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives (known interactions). It indicates how well the model can identify all relevant instances.

To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we also calculated the F-measure, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The F-measure gives a single score that balances both precision and recall, providing a more holistic view of the model's performance. We determined the values of recall and precision at the largest F-measure, which gave us a recall of 69% and a precision of 95% for gene set A. For gene set B, the recall was 77% and the precision was 81%.

These metrics are widely used in the literature and are representative of standard practices in evaluating predictive models, particularly in the context of bioinformatics and gene interaction studies. By reporting these metrics, we aim to provide a clear and transparent assessment of our model's performance, allowing for comparisons with other studies and ensuring that our results are robust and reliable."

PMC4289375	evaluation/comparison		"In our evaluation, we conducted a thorough comparison of our methods with publicly available tools and simpler baselines to ensure robustness and accuracy. For instance, we directly compared the modeled distributions for TargetScan scores with empirically validated interactions. This comparison involved plotting the probability density functions for both predicted and validated miRNA/gene interactions, providing a visual representation of how our model's predictions align with real-world data.

Additionally, we performed overrepresentation analysis (ORA) on different gene sets, including those with experimentally shown and computationally predicted miRNA interactions. This allowed us to assess the precision and recall of our methods against established benchmarks. The results demonstrated that our approach achieved high precision and recall, indicating its effectiveness in identifying relevant miRNA-target interactions.

We also calculated precision and recall for all possible values of the p-value threshold, using the largest F-measure to determine the optimal balance between these metrics. This rigorous evaluation process ensured that our methods were not only accurate but also reliable in practical applications.

Furthermore, we compared our findings with simpler baselines to understand the added value of our more complex models. This included evaluating the performance of our methods against basic statistical approaches and ensuring that our advanced techniques provided significant improvements in prediction accuracy and reliability."

PMC4289375	evaluation/confidence		"In the ""Evaluation Confidence"" subsection, we assessed the reliability and statistical significance of our predictions. We employed a probabilistic approach using Bayes' theorem to estimate the likelihood that a predicted miRNA-gene interaction is valid. This method provided a p-value for each prediction, indicating the probability that the interaction occurs by chance. We set a stringent threshold of p < 0.02 to ensure high confidence in our predictions, which corresponds to a LTS score threshold of 4.06.

To further minimize false positives, we required at least two different predictions with LTS scores above this threshold for a miRNA-gene interaction to be considered acceptable. This restrictive filtering resulted in 6,805 high-confidence predictions involving 1,355 genes. The use of the ABC analysis helped address potential biases due to the unequal distribution of miRNA-gene interactions, ensuring a more balanced evaluation.

The statistical significance of our method was supported by the comparison of modeled distributions for TargetScan scores and empirically validated interactions. The quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot and the probability density function (pdf) demonstrated a strong coincidence with the expected distributions, validating the quality of our model. Additionally, the Pareto Density Estimation (PDE) confirmed the plausibility of our LTS score threshold, providing further confidence in our evaluation metrics.

While we did not explicitly report confidence intervals for our performance metrics, the stringent thresholds and statistical methods used ensure that our results are robust and statistically significant. The approach taken allows us to claim with high confidence that our method provides superior and reliable predictions of miRNA-gene interactions compared to baselines."

All subjects (Npos) are of European ancestry and Caucasian ethnicity. Data were collected from previous studies: Autism Genome Project (AGP), SAGE (Study of Addiction Genetics and Environment), Ontario Colorectal Cancer study, HABC (Health Aging and Body Composition). 	"The dataset utilized in this study comprises subjects with at least one rare copy number variation (CNV). These CNVs were mapped to genes using transcript coordinates based on RefSeq hg18, ensuring consistency with the BeadChip arrays used. The performance of the analysis was similar when using a more stringent exonic mapping, which required at least one exon to be overlapped by a CNV.

The dataset includes a curated set of neurally-relevant genes, which were selected based on various criteria such as predicted haploinsufficiency, brain expression levels, synaptic complex membership, and implication in neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases. These genes were compiled from multiple sources, including the Human Phenotype Ontology, Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, and Gene Ontology annotations.

The total number of subjects in the study is 1,892. The dataset was divided into three equal subsets for cross-validation, each containing the same proportion of cases (ASD subjects) and controls. This stratified three-fold cross-validation approach was employed to avoid overfitting and to ensure robust performance estimation.

The dataset has been used in previous analyses and by the community, as indicated by the references to supplementary methods and results. The cross-validation strategy involved training the model on the union of two subsets and testing it on the remaining subset, repeating this process three times so that each subset was used once as a test set and twice as a training set. This procedure was iterated twenty times to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the area under the curve (AUC), providing a comprehensive assessment of the classification performance."

PMC4315323	dataset/redundancy	Subjects with karyotypic abnormalities, Fragile X syndrome or other genetic syndromes causing congenital malformations were excluded from the analysis. Only samples meeting quality thresholds were used for CNV analysis. CNVs (of size 30 kb or greater) were detected using an analytical pipeline optimized for Illumina 1M arrays. All de novo CNVs were experimentally validated. Samples with copy number variation greater than 7.5 MB were excluded. 	"The dataset was divided into three equal subsets, each containing the same proportion of ASD and control subjects. This division was done to ensure that the data was stratified, which helps to avoid overfitting and ensures that each subset is representative of the overall dataset. The cross-validation strategy involved using two of these subsets for training the model, while the remaining subset was used as the validation set to quantify performance. This process was iterated three times, so that each subset was used twice for training and once for validation. Additionally, the cross-validation procedure was repeated multiple times to estimate the mean performance and its standard deviation.

The feature selection process was performed independently for each training set to avoid overfitting. This means that the features selected for the model were based on the relevance metrics calculated on the training data subset used for that particular iteration. This approach ensures that the training and test sets remain independent, as the feature selection does not rely on information from the test set.

The distribution of the dataset in terms of feature relevance and classification performance was compared to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of ASD research. The challenges addressed in this study, such as the high degree of mutual overlap among features and the presence of many features with limited or no classification relevance, are common in large and complex biological datasets. The use of feature selection strategies like Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA), MDA with stepwise decorrelation, and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) helped to mitigate these issues and improve the classification performance. The results showed that incorporating feature selection steps significantly enhanced the model's ability to distinguish between ASD and control subjects, particularly when using gene ontology (GO) and pathway-based features."

PMC4315323	optimization/algorithm	Random Forest (RF), Conditional Inference Forest (CF), SVM with Linear kernel, Neural network.	"The machine-learning algorithm class used is ensemble learning, specifically tree-based methods. Two main classifiers were employed: Random Forest (RF) and Conditional Inference Forest (CF). RF was initially chosen for its resilience to overfitting and its ability to handle a large feature space. However, CF was later preferred due to its slightly higher performance in certain classifications and its ability to mitigate the positive selection bias towards features with more categorical values that RF exhibits.

Neither RF nor CF are new algorithms. They are well-established methods in the field of machine learning. The choice to use these algorithms in this context was driven by their suitability for the specific problem at hand, which involves classifying subjects based on genetic data. The focus of the publication is on the application of these algorithms to genetic data for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, it is appropriate for this work to be published in a medical genomics journal rather than a machine-learning journal. The emphasis is on the biological insights and the practical application of these methods to genetic data, rather than the innovation of new machine-learning techniques."

PMC4315323	optimization/meta	No	"The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it employs individual machine-learning algorithms to classify subjects based on specific features. The primary classifiers used include Random Forest (RF), Conditional Inference Forest (CF), a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Neural Network (NN). Each of these classifiers was evaluated independently to assess their performance in classifying subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on various genetic features.

The Random Forest and Conditional Inference Forest classifiers were particularly highlighted for their robustness and ability to handle large feature spaces. The performance of these classifiers was compared using a set of 20 curated neurally-relevant features, along with the total gene count. The Conditional Inference Forest was found to have a slightly higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) than the Random Forest when classifying all subjects, but a slightly lower AUC for de novo and pathogenic subjects.

The linear SVM and Neural Network were also evaluated using the same cross-validation strategy and feature set. The results indicated that these classifiers achieved comparable or lower AUC than the Conditional Inference Forest. Additionally, the performance of Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway-based features was assessed, but these features did not outperform the curated neurally-relevant features.

The training data for each classifier was divided using a stratified three-fold cross-validation strategy to avoid overfitting. This approach ensured that the data was split into training and test sets in a way that maintained the same proportion of cases and controls in each subset. The process was repeated multiple times to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the AUC, providing a robust assessment of the classifiers' performance.

In summary, the model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input; rather, it relies on individual classifiers trained on specific genetic features. The training data for each classifier is independent, as ensured by the cross-validation strategy."

Large and very rare CNVs were also classified as pathogenic.  Gene annotations based on CNVs. Gene-set construction, based on CNV gene annotations.	"For the machine-learning algorithms employed in our study, data encoding and preprocessing were tailored to the specific requirements of each classifier. For the Random Forest (RF) and Conditional Forest (CF) classifiers, no explicit feature normalization or scaling was required. These classifiers were implemented using the R/CRAN packages 'randomForest' and 'party', respectively, with default settings unless otherwise specified. The feature relevance metrics utilized for RF included Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease Gini, which were calculated using the randomForest package. MDA was determined by permuting the value of the feature in out-of-bag (OOB) samples and comparing the accuracy of prediction before and after permutation tree by tree. Mean Decrease Gini measured how each feature contributed to the homogeneity of the nodes and leaves.

For the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), each feature was independently normalized and rescaled to a 0-1 interval prior to being input into the classifier. The libSVM package was used in MATLAB R2013a, with the cost parameter kept at the default value of 1 and class weights kept even.

The Neural Network (NN) was built with two middle layers consisting of 100 and 50 nodes each. It was trained using back-propagation and did not require feature normalization or scaling. The learning rate was set to 0.005, affecting the rate of connection weight adaptation, and a momentum of 0.9 was used to accelerate the connection weight adaptation. The NN was also implemented in MATLAB R2013a.

Feature selection strategies were employed to manage the large number and redundancy of features, particularly for Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway-based features. These strategies included MDA-based selection, MDA-based selection with stepwise decorrelation, and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance Feature Selection (MRMR). For each procedure, the top 20, top 15%, and top 40% ranking features were selected, excluding the total gene count, which was then added back. Feature selection was performed independently for every training set to avoid overfitting issues."	B_Better		2026-02-09T15:07:01.844440
PMC4315323	optimization/parameters	For RF and CF default settings were used unless otherwise specified. For Linear SVM the cost parameter was kept at default as 1 and class weights were kept even. Each feature was independently normalized and rescaled to a 0-1 interval prior to being input into the classifier. The Neural Network was built with two middle layers of 100 and 50 nodes each, a learning rate of 0.005 with a 0.9 momentum. The network was trained through back-propagation, and without feature normalization or scaling. 	"In our study, we utilized several parameters to optimize the performance of our models. Specifically, we assessed the impact of different test statistics and mincriterion values on classification performance. The test statistic parameters included options like Quadratic and Max, while the mincriterion values were set at 0.95, 0.75, and 0.5. These parameters were crucial for tree construction in our models, ensuring that features used met a certain threshold of relevance.

The selection of these parameters was guided by their ability to improve classification accuracy and robustness. For instance, we observed that modifying the mincriterion value had a minor effect on performance, with default settings often yielding the best results. This indicates that the chosen parameters were effective in balancing model complexity and performance.

Additionally, we employed feature relevance metrics such as Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease Gini to rank and select features. These metrics helped in identifying the most relevant features for model training, thereby reducing dimensionality and improving classification performance. The number of features selected varied, with top 20, top 15%, and top 40% ranking features being considered, excluding the total gene count and then adding it back.

Overall, the parameters used in our models were carefully chosen and optimized to enhance classification accuracy and robustness, ensuring that the models performed well across different datasets and conditions."

PMC4315323	optimization/features	Clinically categorized CNVs. CNV annotated genes. 20 curated gene-sets of neurobiological relevance. Total gene count.	"In our study, we utilized a variety of features derived from Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and pathways. Initially, we faced challenges due to the high mutual overlap among features and the presence of many features with limited or no classification relevance. To address these issues, we performed classification using all features and also embedded a feature selection step within the cross-validation procedure. The feature selection methods employed included Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) based selection, MDA based selection with stepwise decorrelation, and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) Feature Selection. For each of these procedures, we selected the top 20, top 15%, and top 40% ranking features, excluding the total gene count, and then added the total gene count back into the feature set.

It is crucial to note that feature selection was conducted based on feature relevance metrics calculated on the data subset used for training. This process was performed independently for every training set to avoid overfitting issues. This approach ensured that the selected features were relevant and contributed to the classification performance without biasing the results.

The number of features used as input varied depending on the selection method and the percentage of top-ranking features chosen. However, the final set of features for classification included a subset of the initially considered features, refined through the feature selection process. This refinement helped in managing the large number and redundancy of GO and pathway-based features, although their information content for ASD classification based on rare CNV genes appeared to be more limited compared to the curated neurally-relevant features."

PMC4315323	optimization/fitting	Stratified 3-fold cross-validation was used to avoid overfitting.  The absence of overfitting was further assessed by replacing real classification features with randomized features based on gene identity permutation.  Feature selection was based on the feature relevance metrics calculated on the data subset used for training, and performed independently for every training set, to avoid any overfitting issues. Additionally, all subsets presented a gender composition similar to the full dataset. 	"In our study, we employed a stratified three-fold cross-validation strategy to mitigate overfitting. This approach involved dividing subjects with at least one rare copy number variation (CNV) into three equal subsets, each maintaining the same proportion of cases and controls. The model was trained on the union of two subsets and tested on the remaining subset, a process repeated three times without re-dividing the dataset. This ensured that each subset was used once as a test set and twice as a training set. To further estimate the mean and standard deviation of the area under the curve (AUC), we performed twenty independent cross-validation iterations. This method helped model the classification stochasticity and assess the absence of overfitting.

To rule out overfitting, we also replaced real classification features with randomized features based on gene identity permutation. This step was crucial in verifying that our models did not merely memorize the training data but could generalize to new, unseen data. For the 20 curated neurally-relevant features, the AUC obtained using randomization was similar to the AUC of the total gene count, indicating no evidence of overfitting.

For the neural network and linear support vector machine (SVM), Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway-based features produced better performance than using conditional inference forests (CF), but they were still inferior to the 20 curated features. However, there was potential evidence of some modest degree of overfitting for GO and pathway-based features. The AUC for random features exceeded by more than one AUC absolute unit (and more than two AUC standard deviation units) the AUC for the total gene count only, and was also very close to the AUC of real Gene Ontology features.

Regarding underfitting, we ensured that our models were complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. For instance, the neural network was built with two middle layers of 100 and 50 nodes each, and it was trained through back-propagation. The linear SVM used a cost parameter kept at the default value of 1, and each feature was independently normalized and rescaled to a 0-1 interval prior to being input into the classifier. These configurations helped in achieving a balance between model complexity and generalization performance, thereby avoiding underfitting."	B_Better		2026-02-09T15:11:16.901305
PMC4315323	optimization/regularization	Not specified.	"In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our classification models. One of the primary methods used was stratified three-fold cross-validation. This approach involved dividing the subjects with at least one rare copy number variation (CNV) into three equal subsets, each maintaining the same proportion of cases and controls. The model was trained on the union of two subsets and tested on the remaining subset. This process was repeated three times, ensuring that each subset was used once as a test set and twice as a training set. To further account for stochasticity, we performed twenty independent cross-validation iterations, which allowed us to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the area under the curve (AUC).

Additionally, we assessed the absence of overfitting by replacing real classification features with randomized features based on gene identity permutation. This technique helped us to verify that the performance of our models was not due to overfitting but rather to the genuine relevance of the features used.

For feature selection, we utilized Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance Feature Selection (MRMR). These methods helped in selecting the most relevant features while minimizing redundancy, thereby enhancing the model's performance and reducing the risk of overfitting. The feature selection was performed independently for every training set to avoid any overfitting issues.

Moreover, we compared the performance of different feature selection strategies, including using all features, MDA-based selection, MDA-based selection with stepwise decorrelation, and MRMR. This comprehensive approach ensured that our models were optimized for classification performance while mitigating the risk of overfitting."

PMC4315323	model/interpretability	Feature selection for RF based on Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease Gini. Feature selection for CF based on MDA was performed with and without step-wise decorrelation, and on MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance Feature Selection). Reported in Additional information. Black box for SVM with Linear kernel and Neural network. 	"The models employed in this study exhibit varying degrees of interpretability. The Random Forest (RF) and Conditional Forest (CF) classifiers are generally considered more interpretable than black-box models. This is because they provide feature relevance metrics that can help understand the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.

For RF, two feature relevance metrics were utilized: Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease Gini. MDA measures the impact of permuting a feature's values on the model's accuracy, providing insight into how important each feature is for making accurate predictions. Mean Decrease Gini, on the other hand, assesses how each feature contributes to the homogeneity of the nodes and leaves in the trees, indicating its importance in the decision-making process.

CF also uses MDA for feature selection, which helps in ranking features based on their importance. This allows for a clear understanding of which features are most influential in the model's decisions.

In contrast, the Neural Network (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are more opaque. While the NN was trained through back-propagation and does not require feature normalization or scaling, the internal workings of how it combines features to make predictions are not straightforward to interpret. Similarly, the SVM, despite its effectiveness, does not provide clear insights into feature importance.

Overall, while the RF and CF models offer transparency through their feature relevance metrics, the NN and SVM remain more black-box in nature. This makes RF and CF more suitable for scenarios where interpretability is crucial, allowing researchers to understand the underlying factors contributing to the model's predictions."

We utilized various classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), Conditional Inference Forest (CF), linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN), to classify subjects based on the presence of rare copy number variants (CNVs). The primary goal was to distinguish between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) subjects and controls. The performance of these classifiers was evaluated using metrics such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and the percentage of correctly classified subjects. The CF classifier, in particular, demonstrated robust performance and was used extensively in our analyses.

Percentage of correctly classified ASD subjects, which was calculated as the number of ASD subjects correctly predicted in at least 15 out of 20 iterations divided by the study total (Npos=1892). 	"In our evaluation, we primarily reported the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as our performance metric. This metric is widely used in the literature for evaluating the performance of classification models, particularly in the context of imbalanced datasets, which is common in genetic studies. The AUC provides a single scalar value that represents the ability of the model to distinguish between classes, in this case, between subjects with and without certain genetic conditions.

We calculated the AUC using a stratified three-fold cross-validation strategy. This approach helps to ensure that our results are robust and not due to overfitting. We performed twenty independent cross-validation iterations to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the AUC, providing a measure of the model's performance variability.

In addition to the AUC, we also reported the percentage of correctly classified subjects. This metric is particularly relevant in our study, as it provides a direct measure of the model's ability to correctly identify subjects with specific genetic conditions. We calculated this percentage as the number of subjects correctly predicted in at least 15 out of 20 iterations divided by the total number of subjects in the study.

We also assessed the performance of our models using different gene sets and feature selection methods. For instance, we compared the performance of models using 20 curated neurally-relevant features, Gene Ontology (GO) features, and pathway-based features. This comparison allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of different feature selection strategies and to identify the most informative features for our classification task.

Overall, the set of metrics we reported is representative of the literature in the field of genetic classification. The AUC is a standard metric for evaluating the performance of classification models, and the percentage of correctly classified subjects provides a direct measure of the model's practical utility. Our use of cross-validation and the reporting of performance variability further enhance the robustness and interpretability of our results."

"In our evaluation, we conducted a thorough comparison of our methods with both publicly available techniques and simpler baselines to ensure robustness and validity. We employed a cross-validation strategy where the dataset was divided into three equal subsets, each containing the same proportion of ASD and control subjects. Two of these subsets were used for training the model, while the remaining subset served as the validation set for performance quantification. This process was iterated three times, ensuring that each subset was used twice for training and once for validation. The feature selection was specifically applied to GO and pathway-based features, with the remaining set used as the test set to assess classification performance.

We compared our results with those obtained using linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN), utilizing the same cross-validation strategy and the 20 curated neurally-relevant features. Both the linear SVM and NN achieved comparable or lower AUC than our method, indicating that our approach outperformed these alternatives. Importantly, we did not find evidence of overfitting, as the AUC obtained using the randomization of the 20 curated neurally-relevant features was similar to the AUC of the total gene count.

For both the neural network and the linear SVM, GO and pathway-based features produced better performance than using CF, yet still inferior to the 20 curated features. However, we found potential evidence of some modest degree of overfitting for GO and pathway-based features, as the AUC for random features exceeded by more than one AUC absolute unit (and more than two AUC standard deviation units) the AUC for the total gene count only, and was also very close to the AUC of real Gene Ontology features.

Additionally, we tested different inferential statistics used by CF for tree construction and observed minor differences in performance.

The performance metrics, such as AUC, are presented with standard deviations, which indicate the variability and confidence intervals of the results. For instance, the AUC values for different classifiers and feature sets are accompanied by standard deviations, allowing for an assessment of the statistical significance of the differences observed. This approach ensures that the reported performance metrics are reliable and that the claimed superiority of certain methods over others is statistically significant.

Additionally, we assessed the absence of overfitting by replacing real classification features with randomized features based on gene identity permutation.

"The dataset used in this study is derived from a collection of drugs known to interact with specific transporters, namely OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, and OCT2. These transporters are part of the SLC22 family, which is known for handling a diverse range of compounds. The dataset includes approximately 250 drugs, each characterized by their physicochemical properties. These properties were calculated using computational chemistry software such as ICM and tabulated using the KNIME workflow platform. The dataset focuses on drugs that exhibit high-affinity interactions with these transporters, with a particular emphasis on non-overlapping drugs, i.e., those that interact with only one transporter at a high affinity.

The physicochemical properties of the drugs were determined using about 50 attributes calculated with ICM, including molecular quantum numbers, atom counts, bond counts, polarity counts, and topology counts. Additionally, around 100 chemical features were added using KNIME with extensions from RDKit, Indigo, and CDK, such as molecular weight, molecular volume, Log P, Log S, and polar surface area. A class variable was also included to represent the specific transporter with which each drug interacts.

The dataset leverages inhibition (Ki) data, which is more readily available compared to transport (Km) data. This choice is consistent with the broader field of SLC and ABC drug transporters, where inhibition data is commonly used due to its availability. The dataset has been used to perform systematic computational and statistical analyses, as well as machine-learning analyses, to understand the functional differences between the transporters and the physicochemical properties that influence their interactions with ligands. The results of these analyses have been validated through various machine-learning models, including decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, decision rules, and naïve Bayes."

We conducted six pairwise comparison studies: OAT1 versus OCT1, OAT1 versus OCT2, OAT3 versus OCT1, OAT3 versus OCT2, OAT1 versus OAT3, and OCT1 versus OCT2. For each comparison, we eliminated ""overlapping"" drugs, which are those that displayed high-affinity interactions with both of the transporters being compared. This step was crucial to ensure that the datasets were independent and that the models could accurately distinguish between the transporters based on the physicochemical properties of the drugs.

The elimination of overlapping drugs helped in creating distinct datasets for each pairwise comparison, thereby enforcing independence between the training and test sets. This approach ensured that the models were not biased by drugs that interacted with multiple transporters, which could otherwise confound the results.

Regarding the distribution of our datasets compared to previously published machine-learning datasets, our approach of using nonoverlapping drugs for each comparison is a strength. It allows for a more precise identification of the physicochemical descriptors that separate the transporters. This method ensures that the models are trained on drugs that are specific to each transporter, leading to more accurate and interpretable results. The use of a large dataset, despite the limitations, was experimentally validated and is reasonable given the structural diversity of the compounds handled by the transporters. As more data becomes available and machine-learning techniques continue to improve, the clarity of the chemical features enabling transport by different SLC and/or ABC transporters is expected to increase."

These include decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks. These algorithms are implemented using the Weka machine-learning software, which is an open-source collection of machine-learning algorithms developed by the University of Waikato.

The algorithms employed are not new; they have been extensively used and validated in various scientific and machine-learning applications. The decision to use these established algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in classification tasks and their ability to provide interpretable models, which is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of transporter binding and interaction.

The choice of algorithms was also influenced by the need for models that could help explain the data rather than just classify it. For instance, while neural network models are highly accurate classifiers, they are often considered ""black box"" models because they do not provide clear insights into the decision-making process. In contrast, decision tree and decision rule models offer a more interpretable structure, making them preferable for this study.

The use of these algorithms in a biological context, specifically for studying transporter selectivity, is what sets this work apart. The focus is on applying these machine-learning techniques to a specific biological problem, rather than developing new algorithms.

Several different machine-learning models were employed, including decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks. Each of these models was used to develop classification models that could help explain transporter binding/interaction data.

Decision trees were particularly useful because they are interpretable, with each node representing a variable and each branch representing a data split based on the value of that variable. Random forests, which are ensembles of decision trees, were also used. These forests were trained with different bootstrap samples, and the ensemble was averaged to produce an aggregate classification. The trees within the random forest were slightly decorrelated by limiting the choice of variables during tree induction, which allowed for different combinations of variables to fill out the tree branches.

The use of multiple machine-learning methods demonstrated that there is a boundary related to transporter selectivity. Different decision trees were generated within a given model, depending on the features selected, which was likely due to the overlap in molecular characteristics captured by various attributes. Multiple iterations of the algorithms and parameters were explored to arrive at models with the best validation scores.

Statistical tests were also conducted to study the significance of the calculated differences between ligand transporter interactions. T-tests were performed on the physiologic properties to determine if the differences in the mean values for each were statistically significant between the two groups of drugs. The physiologic properties were then ranked according to their P-values.

In summary, while various machine-learning methods were used, there was no explicit meta-predictor that combined the outputs of these models.

They just mention the elimination of non valid attributes (e.g. missing or NaN value for some features) and the selection of attributes through Chi Square Evaluation.	"The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, drugs were categorized based on their net charge as cationic, anionic, neutral, or zwitterionic neutral. The percentage of each charge species was determined using pH/concentration curves at pH values of 7.2, 7.4, and 7.6. This resulted in the calculation of total positive, negative, neutral, and zwitterionic neutral species percentages for individual charge-species bar diagrams.

For the machine-learning analyses, the study focused on nonoverlapping drugs, which interacted with high affinity for only one transporter. Physicochemical properties of the drugs were calculated using ICM and tabulated in KNIME, an open-source workflow platform for machine-learning. About 50 physicochemical attributes, including molecular quantum numbers, atom counts, bond counts, polarity counts, and topology counts, were calculated using ICM. Additionally, approximately 100 chemical features for each drug, such as molecular weight, molecular volume, Log P, Log S, and polar surface area, were added using KNIME extensions capable of collecting data from RDKIT, Indigo, and CDK.

A class variable was also included to represent the transporter with which a given drug would interact. The raw data extracted from KNIME and ICM contained some attributes that were overlapping, empty, or constant, and these were eliminated. Weka's attribute-selection feature, Chi Square Evaluator, was used to rank the attributes according to their contribution to predicting the class variable. This involved binarizing real-valued variables and testing the expected-minus-observed counts with respect to the class.

After preprocessing, machine-learning algorithms were employed to develop models. Drugs with high affinity for the transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, and OCT2 were treated as instances, and their physicochemical properties were used as attributes. Six pairwise comparison studies were conducted, excluding overlapping drugs that displayed high-affinity interaction with both of the transporters being compared. Several Weka machine-learning models, including decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks, were used to develop well-validated classification models."

The selection of these parameters was driven by their importance in distinguishing between drugs that interact with different transporters. Initially, charge state information was found to be dominant in classifying drugs. However, to explore the role of other physicochemical properties, decision trees were constructed excluding charge properties. This process helped identify additional key determinants, such as the number of acyclic double bonds, acyclic oxygens, and the SP3 character.

Multiple iterations of the algorithms and parameters were explored to arrive at models with the best validation scores. The final set of parameters used in the models was determined through a combination of statistical analysis and machine-learning techniques, ensuring that the most relevant properties were included.

This process involved dividing the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This procedure was repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This approach helped to ensure that the models were not overfitting to the training data and provided a more reliable estimate of their performance.

Additionally, decision trees were pruned to improve performance. Pruning involves removing parts of the tree that provide little power in classifying instances. This technique helps to simplify the model and reduce the likelihood of overfitting by eliminating branches that capture noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern.

Random forests, which are ensembles of decision trees, were also utilized. These models incorporate bootstrap sampling and variable decorrelation, which help to reduce overfitting by averaging the results of multiple trees trained on different subsets of the data. The random forest approach further enhances the robustness of the models by considering the importance of different variables and their interactions.

In summary, cross-validation, decision tree pruning, and the use of random forests were key techniques employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the reliability of our machine-learning models."

PMC5034704	model/interpretability	Both transparent (e.g. Decision Trees) and black box algorithms (e.g. Neural Networks) were used.	"The models employed in this study encompass both transparent and black-box approaches. Decision trees and decision rules are among the most interpretable models used. In a decision tree, each node represents a variable, and each branch signifies a data split based on the variable's value. This structure allows for a clear, step-by-step path that leads to a class prediction, making it easy to understand the decisions made by the model. For instance, in the comparison between OAT1 and OCT1, the decision tree might first split based on the number of acyclic divalent nodes, classifying drugs with zero such nodes as OCT1 drugs. Subsequent splits might consider other attributes like the number of acyclic double bonds or acyclic oxygens, providing a transparent view of how different physicochemical properties influence the classification.

Random forests, while slightly more complex, also offer interpretability through variable importance plots. These plots rank the significance of various attributes in predicting transporter interactions, with charge state information often dominating. Following charge, attributes like the number of acyclic double bonds, acyclic oxygens, and SP3 character are highlighted, indicating their importance in distinguishing between different transporter interactions. This approach ensures that the model's decisions are not entirely opaque, as the contribution of each variable can be assessed.

In contrast, neural network models are considered black-box models. While they are highly accurate classifiers, they lack the transparency of decision trees and random forests. Neural networks do not provide a clear, interpretable path for how inputs lead to outputs, making it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the classifications. However, their accuracy makes them valuable for predictive purposes, even if the decision-making process remains less clear.

Overall, the preference for models that can explain transporter binding/interaction data is evident. Decision trees and random forests, with their interpretable structures and variable importance rankings, are favored for their ability to provide insights into the physicochemical properties that influence transporter selectivity. This transparency is crucial for understanding the underlying biology and for validating the models with experimental data."

PMC5034704	model/output	Classification	"The models developed in this study are primarily classification models. They were designed to distinguish between drugs that have a high affinity for specific transporters (OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, and OCT2) based on their physicochemical properties. Various machine-learning algorithms, including decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks, were employed to create these classification models. The goal was to identify which attributes of the drugs were most important in determining their interaction with these transporters. The models were validated to ensure their accuracy and reliability in classifying the drugs.

Decision trees were particularly useful in this context because they provide an interpretable way to understand the decisions made by the model. Each node in a decision tree represents a variable, and each branch represents a data split based on the value of that variable. This structure allows for a clear path to a class prediction, making it easier to explain the transporter binding/interaction data.

Random forest models, which are an ensemble of decision trees, were also used. These models improve classification accuracy by averaging the results of multiple trees, each trained on different bootstrap samples. The random forest approach also helps in estimating the importance of different variables, providing insights into which physicochemical properties are most influential in determining transporter selectivity.

In summary, the models developed are classification models that use various machine-learning techniques to predict the interaction of drugs with specific transporters based on their physicochemical properties. Decision trees and random forests were particularly useful due to their interpretability and ability to handle complex data."	B_Better		2026-02-09T15:42:06.038566

PMC5034704	evaluation/method	Experimental Validation	"The evaluation of the machine-learning models involved several rigorous steps to ensure their validity and reliability. Initially, the models were developed using drugs that exhibited high affinity for specific transporters, with their physicochemical properties serving as attributes. To avoid bias, drugs that showed high-affinity interaction with more than one transporter in pairwise comparisons were excluded from the analysis.

Multiple machine-learning algorithms were employed, including decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks. The preference was for models that could explain transporter binding/interaction data, with decision trees and decision rules being particularly favored due to their interpretability. Neural networks, while accurate classifiers, were considered less useful for defining distinguishing properties due to their ""black box"" nature.

The models were validated through cross-validation procedures, where trees were induced and then pruned to improve performance. This process helped in ensuring that the models were not overfitting the data. The success rates of different algorithms were comparable, indicating a clear boundary related to transporter selectivity.

In addition to machine-learning approaches, statistical tests were conducted to study the significance of calculated differences between ligand-transporter interactions. T-tests were performed on the physiologic properties to determine if the differences in mean values were statistically significant between the two groups of drugs. The physiologic properties were then ranked according to their P-values.

The evaluation also included experimental validation. For instance, a pharmacophore model for OAT3 was used for virtual screening, identifying potential new OAT3 cationic ligands. Six top hits were selected and tested in wet laboratory transport assays. Four of these ligands were found to interact with OAT3, with strong inhibition of tracer uptake, while only two showed lower affinity interaction with OAT1. This experimental validation supported the findings from the machine-learning analysis and the pharmacophore models.

Overall, the evaluation method combined computational, statistical, and experimental approaches to ensure the robustness and reliability of the models developed."	B_Better	need more to the point response and objetcive bu copilot in this field	2026-02-09T15:44:58.988480
PMC5034704	evaluation/measure	ROC Area	"In the evaluation of our machine-learning models, several performance metrics were reported to assess the effectiveness of the classifiers. The primary metric used was the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area, which provides a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between different classes. This metric was calculated for each of the six pairwise comparison studies: OAT1 versus OCT1, OAT1 versus OCT2, OAT3 versus OCT1, OAT3 versus OCT2, OAT1 versus OAT3, and OCT1 versus OCT2. The ROC areas were determined using 10-fold cross-validation, ensuring that the results were robust and not dependent on a particular subset of the data.

The ROC area is a well-established metric in the literature for evaluating classification models, particularly in the context of drug-transporter interactions. It provides a comprehensive view of the model's performance across all threshold levels, making it a reliable indicator of the model's discriminative power. Additionally, the ROC area is less sensitive to class imbalances compared to other metrics, such as accuracy, which is crucial given the varying numbers of high-affinity drugs for different transporters.

In addition to the ROC area, the models were also evaluated based on their validation performance. Models that demonstrated good validation scores were preferred, as they indicated the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. This is particularly important in the context of drug-transporter interactions, where the goal is to identify physicochemical properties that can predict transporter selectivity.

The use of ROC areas and validation performance metrics is representative of standard practices in the field of machine learning and drug discovery. These metrics have been widely used in the literature to evaluate the performance of classification models, ensuring that our results are comparable to other studies in this domain. The focus on these metrics allows for a clear and concise evaluation of the models' effectiveness in distinguishing between different transporter interactions."	B_Better		2026-02-09T15:45:17.104789
PMC5034704	evaluation/comparison	Comparison was made among the methods used, based on the ROC Area	"In our study, we employed several machine-learning algorithms to develop models for distinguishing drugs based on their affinity for specific transporters. The algorithms used included decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks. Each of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses, but our focus was on models that could provide insights into the physicochemical properties influencing transporter binding.

Decision trees were particularly useful because they offer interpretability. Each node in a decision tree represents a variable, and each branch represents a data split based on the value of that variable. This structure allows for a clear understanding of how different physicochemical properties contribute to the classification of drugs. Decision trees were induced by ranking variables based on their ability to split the data effectively, and the process was repeated for each branch until the nodes mostly reflected one class or the other. Pruning was applied to improve performance in cross-validation.

Random forests, an ensemble of decision trees, were also utilized. Each tree in a random forest is trained with different bootstrap samples, and the ensemble is averaged to produce an aggregate classification. This method decorrelates the trees by limiting the choice of variables during induction, which helps in estimating the importance of variables and their interactions. The random forest approach provides a robust measure of variable importance, considering both main effects and interactions.

Statistical tests, such as t-tests, were performed to study the significance of differences between ligand-transporter interactions. These tests helped in ranking physiologic properties based on their P-values, providing a statistical foundation for the machine-learning analyses. The attributes with the lowest P-values were consistent with the findings from the machine-learning models, reinforcing the reliability of our results.

In summary, our methods comparison involved using multiple machine-learning techniques and statistical analyses to ensure robust and interpretable results. Decision trees and random forests were particularly valuable for their ability to provide insights into the physicochemical properties that influence transporter binding. The consistency between statistical tests and machine-learning models further validated our findings."

PMC5034704	evaluation/confidence	Not stated	"The evaluation of the machine-learning models employed in this study involved several key aspects that contribute to the confidence in the results. Multiple machine-learning algorithms were used, including decision trees, decision rules, support vector machines, Bayesian models, and neural networks. The performance of these models was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation, which helps to ensure that the results are robust and not dependent on a particular subset of the data.

The performance metrics, such as the weighted-average receiver operating characteristic (ROC) areas, provide a quantitative measure of the models' effectiveness. These metrics were calculated for various pairwise comparisons of transporters, and the results are summarized in a table. The ROC areas indicate the models' ability to distinguish between different classes of drugs based on their physicochemical properties.

Statistical tests, such as t-tests, were performed to study the significance of the calculated differences between ligand transporter interactions. These tests helped to identify which physicochemical properties were statistically significant in distinguishing between the transporters. The attributes with the lowest P values were considered the most important, and these were consistent with the findings from the machine-learning analyses.

The decision trees and random forests provided not only classification success but also a logical way to demonstrate how physicochemical properties of the ligands affect the binding interaction between ligands and transporters. The models were validated, and the results showed that there are analyzable boundaries related to transporter selectivity.

In summary, the performance metrics have confidence intervals implied by the cross-validation process, and the results are statistically significant. The use of multiple algorithms and the consistency of the findings across different methods enhance the confidence in the superiority of the approach."

PMC5079830	dataset/provenance	1) regression data : 355 compounds from ChEMBL bioactivity database for training the regressor, 2) classification data : DUD-E dataset (102 target proteins, 20000 active molecules and more than a million decoy molecules); classes active/decoy. The validation/testing of the predictive methods is done on the D3R data form HSP90 and MAP4K4. They generate 29K poses for the former to test their predictors and 5329 poses for the latter. No mention of which ones are active fits and which ones are decoys. 	"The dataset used in our study primarily comes from the Directory of Useful Decoys-Enhanced (DUD-E) dataset. This dataset is notable for its large size, encompassing 102 targets, over 20,000 active molecules, and more than a million decoy molecules. The DUD-E dataset is particularly valuable for its extensive coverage, although it lacks protein-ligand structures, which we addressed by using docked poses for training our models.

Additionally, we utilized the ChEMBL bioactivity database to extract compounds with published activity for the HSP90 alpha target. Specifically, we collected 355 active compounds from the ChEMBL3880 target, which had IC50 values expressed in nM units and a pChEMBL greater than zero. These compounds were used to create our ligand-based regression models.

For the MAP4K4 dataset, we had 30 compounds, all with co-crystal structures, but only 18 of these had measured IC50 data. This dataset is particularly useful for evaluating pose prediction performance.

The DUD-E dataset has been widely used in the community for virtual screening and docking studies due to its comprehensive nature. Our approach involved using docked poses from DUD-E to train structure-based models, which allowed us to leverage the large amount of high-throughput screening data available. This method framed the problem as a classification between binders and non-binders, normalizing for different assay outcomes and utilizing binding data in a structure-based approach."

"In our study, we utilized the DUD-E dataset to generate structural training sets. This dataset is notable for its large size, encompassing 102 targets, over 20,000 active molecules, and more than a million decoy molecules. The dataset was split into different subsets to evaluate various training approaches. We created a balanced set with equal numbers of decoy and active compounds to enhance the signal from the active set. Additionally, we extracted a target-specific set for HSP90 from these larger training sets.

To ensure the independence of the training and test sets, we employed a classification approach that leveraged high-throughput screening data. This approach involved docking ligands to generate protein-ligand structures, resulting in a large but noisy dataset. The training sets were constructed using docked poses, with the top-ranked pose selected for each ligand. This method helped to normalize for different assay outcomes and provided a robust framework for evaluating the performance of our machine learning models.

The distribution of our training sets differs from previously published machine learning datasets in that it includes a significant number of decoy molecules, making it highly imbalanced. This imbalance was addressed by creating a balanced subset, which improved the performance of our models. The use of the DUD-E dataset, with its extensive collection of decoys, allowed us to evaluate the feasibility of training set construction approaches and compare different methods for enhancing the signal from active compounds."

This code can be used to replicate the models and the approach described in the supplementary information. However, the actual datasets, such as the DUD-E dataset and the specific splits used for training and testing, are not made publicly available. This is because the DUD-E dataset itself is not openly accessible and requires proper licensing and permissions for use.

PMC5079830	optimization/algorithm	1) Elastic net linear model for affinity prediction, 2) linear regression models (linear and logistic) and neural network for pose prediction (active versus decoy).  The linear model was submitted for D3R	"The machine-learning algorithms used in our study fall into two main classes: parametric and non-parametric methods. Parametric methods include linear regression, which was employed to parameterize empirical scoring functions. Non-parametric methods, such as neural networks, were also utilized for their greater flexibility and expressiveness, allowing them to learn both model structure and parameters from data.

The neural network model we implemented is not entirely new but was tailored for our specific application. It consists of a single hidden layer with 20 nodes and uses sigmoid activation in the hidden layer along with a softmax function for output normalization. This model was trained using stochastic gradient descent with an inverse learning rate decay function and momentum to minimize the multinomial logistic loss. The choice to use this particular architecture and training method was driven by the need to handle the large, noisy dataset of docked poses effectively.

The reason this neural network model was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of our work was on applying machine learning techniques to the specific problem of protein-ligand interaction scoring, rather than on developing novel machine-learning algorithms. Our primary goal was to evaluate the performance of these methods in the context of drug design and virtual screening, which is more aligned with the scope of journals in computational chemistry and molecular modeling. The neural network served as a tool to achieve this goal, and its implementation details were included to ensure reproducibility and transparency in our methodology."

PMC5079830	optimization/encoding	1) training data is transformed into Boolean fingerprints, 2) training data for classifier is translated into numerical vectors	"For the machine-learning algorithms employed in our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the models could effectively learn from the input features. We utilized several types of descriptors to represent the molecular structures and their interactions.

For the ligand-based regression models, we employed various chemical fingerprints generated using RDKit. These fingerprints included default RDKit fingerprints, unfolded path fingerprints, and circular ECFP6 fingerprints. These fingerprints encode the structural and chemical properties of the ligands in a binary format, which serves as the input features (X) for our predictive linear models.

In the structure-based classification workflow, we transformed each protein-ligand pose into a numerical vector of interaction features. These features were computed using smina and custom code. The custom code was primarily used to calculate descriptors that included a solvent accessible surface area (SASA) term, which smina does not compute. The interaction features encompassed a wide range of terms, including steric, hydrophobic, van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, solvation, and electrostatic interactions. Partial charges for electrostatic interactions were computed using Open Babel. Additionally, we included non-interaction count/summation terms and the AutoDock Vina score, resulting in a total of 61 features for each protein-ligand pose.

To handle the imbalanced nature of our training dataset, which was dominated by decoy molecules, we created a balanced dataset with equal numbers of active and decoy compounds. This balancing step was essential to enhance the signal exhibited by the active set and to improve the model's ability to distinguish between binders and non-binders.

For internal validation, we used clustered cross-validation, where the training set was partitioned at the target granularity into multiple folds. This approach provided a greater measure of generalizability, as trained models were tested on entirely new targets.

In summary, the data encoding process involved converting molecular structures into numerical vectors using chemical fingerprints and interaction features. Preprocessing steps included balancing the dataset and using clustered cross-validation for robust model evaluation. These steps ensured that our machine-learning algorithms could effectively learn from the input data and make accurate predictions."	B_Better		2026-02-09T17:12:20.423732

"In our study, we utilized a total of 61 features for our models. These features encompassed a variety of interaction terms, including steric, hydrophobic, van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, solvation, and electrostatic interactions. Additionally, we included non-interaction count/summation terms and the AutoDock Vina score.

For the selection of parameters, we employed an internal cross-validation approach. This method involved partitioning the training set into multiple folds to ensure that the models were tested on entirely new targets, thereby providing a greater measure of generalizability. Specifically, we used clustered cross-validation to evaluate the models' ability to properly rank compounds. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used as the primary metric for evaluation. A perfect ranking of ligands would produce an AUC of 1.0, while a random ranking would result in an AUC of 0.5.

For the linear regression model, we found that both linear regression and logistic regression produced nearly identical results in our cross-validation analysis. Given that linear models are faster to evaluate and train, have more interpretable coefficients, and produce a wider range of prediction values, we selected a linear regression model for our submission.

For the neural network model, we trained a neural net with a single hidden layer of 20 nodes and two output classes (active or decoy). The model used sigmoid activation in the hidden layer and a softmax function to normalize the output. Training occurred for 10,000 iterations with a batch size of 20,000 examples. Class weights were applied when computing the loss to balance the influence of negative examples with the underrepresented positive examples. The 10-fold cross-validated AUC for the model was 0.74 using the balanced dataset and 0.73 on the unbalanced dataset."

PMC5079830	optimization/features	no feature selection was performed. 2) classifier has 61 features and 1) size of bit pattern defines number of features in the regressor (2048 or more)	"In our study, we utilized a total of 61 features as input for our models. These features were derived from protein-ligand interactions and included various terms such as steric, hydrophobic, van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, solvation, and electrostatic interactions. Additionally, we incorporated the AutoDock Vina score and custom-calculated descriptors like solvent accessible surface area (SASA) terms.

Feature selection was inherently performed through the use of regularization techniques in our Elastic Net linear model. This model includes both L1 and L2 regularization factors, which drive some weight values to zero, effectively reducing the number of selected features. This process helps in mitigating overfitting by simplifying the model.

The regularization parameters were set using an internal cross-validation approach, ensuring that the feature selection was performed using only the training set. This method helps in identifying the best parameters for the training data, thereby enhancing the model's generalizability and performance."	B_Better		2026-02-09T17:13:25.963998
PMC5079830	optimization/fitting	classifier has less parameters than samples.  	"In our study, we employed both parametric and non-parametric machine learning methods, each with its own set of considerations regarding overfitting and underfitting.

For the parametric methods, such as linear regression and elastic net, the number of parameters is typically much smaller than the number of training points. This inherently reduces the risk of overfitting. However, to further mitigate this risk, we used regularization techniques. Specifically, the elastic net model includes both L1 and L2 regularization factors, which help to drive weight values to zero, thereby reducing the number of selected features and minimizing overfitting. We also applied internal cross-validation to identify the best regularization parameters for the training set, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

For the non-parametric methods, such as neural networks, the risk of overfitting is higher due to their increased flexibility and expressiveness. To address this, we employed rigorous validation techniques, including clustered cross-validation, where the training set was partitioned at a target granularity into multiple folds. This approach provides a greater measure of generalizability since trained models are tested on entirely new targets. Additionally, for the neural network model, we used class weights to balance the influence of negative examples with the underrepresented positive examples, which helps in handling the imbalanced dataset.

To rule out underfitting, we ensured that our models were sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. For instance, the neural network model was trained with a single hidden layer of 20 nodes, which provided enough capacity to learn from the data without being too simplistic. Furthermore, we evaluated multiple models and selected the one that performed best in cross-validation, ensuring that the model was neither too simple nor too complex.

In summary, we carefully balanced the complexity of our models to avoid both overfitting and underfitting. Regularization, cross-validation, and model selection were key strategies employed to achieve this balance."	B_Better		2026-02-09T17:17:50.870792
PMC5079830	optimization/regularization	Cross-validation performed to determine the generalisation of the predictions.	In our study, we employed regularization techniques to prevent overfitting in our predictive models. Specifically, we used the Elastic Net linear model, which incorporates both L1 and L2 regularization factors. These factors help to control the degree of regularization, driving weight values towards zero and thereby reducing the number of selected features. This approach minimizes overfitting by simplifying the model, albeit at the cost of reduced expressiveness. To determine the optimal regularization parameters, we applied internal cross-validation. This method ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data by evaluating its performance on different subsets of the training set.

However, the code used to build the models is available under a permissive open-source license at a specified GitHub repository. This repository likely contains the necessary details for reproducing the experiments, including optimization parameters and schedules. The specific license type is not mentioned, but it is described as permissive, which typically allows for free use, modification, and distribution.

For the neural network model, specific details about the configuration are provided. The model used a single hidden layer with 20 nodes and two output classes (active or decoy). It employed sigmoid activation in the hidden layer and a softmax function to normalize the output. Training occurred for 10,000 iterations with a batch size of 20,000 examples. The optimization used stochastic gradient descent with an inverse learning rate decay function and momentum to minimize the multinomial logistic loss. These details should be sufficient for reproducing the neural network model.

For the linear regression model, default parameters from the scikit-learn library were used, which are well-documented and readily available. The model achieved an average AUC of 0.77 in 10-fold cross-validation, indicating its performance and stability.

In summary, while the exact optimization parameters and schedules are not fully detailed, the provided information and the open-source code repository should enable reproduction of the models and experiments.

PMC5079830	model/interpretability	the weights of the regressor explain the importance of the features.  The NN is black box 	"The models we employed in our study exhibit varying degrees of interpretability. The linear regression model, in particular, is highly transparent. This model provides interpretable coefficients that directly relate to the input features, allowing for a clear understanding of how each feature contributes to the final prediction. This transparency is beneficial for identifying key interactions and understanding the underlying mechanisms driving the model's predictions.

In contrast, the neural network model is more of a black-box model. While it offers greater flexibility and expressiveness, the relationships between input features and outputs are less straightforward. The neural network learns complex, non-linear relationships from the data, making it difficult to interpret the specific contributions of individual features to the final prediction.

The elastic net linear model also falls into the category of interpretable models. It combines L1 and L2 regularization, which helps in feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero. This results in a sparse model where only the most relevant features are retained, enhancing interpretability.

Overall, while the linear regression and elastic net models offer clear insights into the feature importance and relationships, the neural network model provides more abstract and less interpretable predictions."	B_Better		2026-02-09T17:19:17.899360
PMC5079830	model/output	both, 	"The model encompasses both classification and regression approaches. For the structure-based workflow, classification models were employed to distinguish between binders and non-binders using docked poses. These models were then used to re-rank and select docked poses of the ligands. The classification models included linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. The linear regression and logistic regression models achieved an average AUC of 0.77 in 10-fold cross-validation when trained on the balanced training set. The neural network model, with a single hidden layer of 20 nodes and two output classes (active or decoy), achieved an AUC of 0.74 using the balanced dataset and 0.73 on the unbalanced dataset.

For the ligand-based approach, regression models were trained from binding affinity data using various chemical fingerprints.

The models used for predictions were trained on the entire training set. The linear regression model was selected for submission due to its faster evaluation and training times, more interpretable coefficients, and a wider range of prediction values compared to logistic regression."

PMC5079830	model/duration	not mentioned but linear regression is fast 	"The execution time for our models varied depending on the type of model and the dataset used. For the linear regression model, which was implemented using scikit-learn with default parameters, the training and evaluation process was relatively fast. This model achieved an average AUC of 0.77 in 10-fold cross-validation when trained on the balanced training set. The speed of linear models is one of the reasons we selected linear regression for our submission, as they are faster to evaluate and train compared to more complex models.

The neural network model, on the other hand, required more computational resources and time. This model was trained using the Caffe deep learning framework with a single hidden layer of 20 nodes and two output classes. The training occurred for 10,000 iterations with a batch size of 20,000 examples. Despite the increased computational demand, the neural network model performed well, achieving a 10-fold cross-validated AUC of 0.74 using the balanced dataset and 0.73 on the unbalanced dataset.

For the test set, the provided SMILES of the ligands were converted into a single conformer with RDKit and then docked with smina. The docking process involved increased sampling to identify high-quality poses, which added to the overall execution time. For the HSP90 target, up to 9 distinct poses were generated for each receptor structure, resulting in a total of 21,893 poses. For MAP4K4, a 100ns molecular dynamics simulation was run using Amber14, and compounds were docked to ten diverse frames from the simulation, generating a total of 5,329 poses.

In summary, while the linear regression model was quicker to train and evaluate, the neural network model required more time due to its complexity and the number of iterations. The docking process for the test set also contributed significantly to the overall execution time, especially with the increased sampling and the generation of multiple poses for each ligand."

PMC5079830	evaluation/method	Cross-validation when training the classifiers and the test set is independent as it is provided by the D3R challenge	"For the evaluation of our models, we employed clustered cross-validation to ensure greater generalizability. This involved partitioning the DUD-E training set into multiple folds at a specified target granularity. By doing so, we ensured that the trained models were tested on entirely new targets, providing a robust measure of their performance.

In the context of classification, we assessed the models' ability to rank compounds accurately using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. An AUC of 1.0 indicates perfect ranking, while an AUC of 0.5 suggests random ranking. This metric was crucial for evaluating how well our models could distinguish between active and decoy compounds.

For internal validation, we used both linear regression and logistic regression models. Both models achieved an average AUC of 0.77 in 10-fold cross-validation when trained on a balanced dataset. Given that linear models are faster to evaluate and train, have more interpretable coefficients, and produce a wider range of prediction values, we selected a linear regression model for our submissions.

For the test set, we converted the provided SMILES of the D3R ligands into a single conformer using RDKit and then docked them with smina. The binding site was defined using the cognate ligand of the receptor, and we increased the amount of sampling during docking to enhance the identification of high-quality poses. For the HSP90 target, we considered variations of the receptor structures with zero, one, or two waters within the binding site. For MAP4K4, we evaluated the flexibility of the binding site by considering different receptor structures.

In summary, our evaluation method involved a combination of clustered cross-validation, AUC assessment, and extensive docking simulations to ensure the robustness and generalizability of our models."	B_Better		2026-02-09T17:22:46.552527

For classification tasks, such as virtual screening, we used the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This metric ranges from 0.5 for random ranking to 1.0 for perfect ranking, providing a clear measure of how well our models discriminate between active and inactive compounds.

For pose prediction, we evaluated the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the predicted poses compared to the crystal structures. This metric helps us understand how accurately our models can predict the binding poses of ligands. We also considered the rank at which the lowest RMSD poses were found, which is crucial for understanding the practical utility of our scoring functions.

In addition to these, we reported Spearman correlation coefficients to evaluate the affinity prediction performance. This metric assesses the monotonic relationship between predicted and experimental binding affinities, providing insight into how well our models can predict the strength of ligand-receptor interactions.

These performance metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating molecular docking and scoring functions. They provide a comprehensive view of our models' capabilities in virtual screening, pose prediction, and affinity prediction, making our evaluation representative and comparable to other studies in the field."

For instance, Vina achieved the highest AUC of 0.65 in virtual screening performance, but our structure-based methods trained using the balanced set and the ECFP6 ligand-based method performed similarly with AUCs of 0.63 or better.

We also evaluated simpler baselines, such as molecular weight, to understand the baseline performance. For the HSP90 ligands, the neural net model achieved a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.40, which was not substantially higher than the dataset’s correlation with molecular weight (0.34). This comparison helped us understand the relative performance of our more complex models against simpler baselines.

For the MAP4K4 dataset, we compared the performance of different methods in pose prediction and affinity prediction. The MAP4K4 dataset had fewer compounds with reported activities, making it challenging to compare methods meaningfully. However, we evaluated the affinity prediction performance by scoring the pose with the closest RMSD to the crystal ligand, which did not result in improved correlations.

Overall, our evaluation included comparisons to both publicly available methods and simpler baselines, providing a thorough assessment of our approaches."	B_Better		2026-02-09T17:26:08.700606

Significance is mentioned but no p-values are provided	"In our evaluation, we have taken steps to ensure that our performance metrics are robust and reliable. For the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curves, which assesses the ability of various methods to rank HSP90 ligand poses, we have included error bars indicating the 95% confidence interval. These intervals were determined through bootstrapping with replacement, using 1000 iterations. This approach provides a measure of the uncertainty associated with our AUC estimates.

Similarly, for the Spearman correlation coefficients used to evaluate the ranking of HSP90 and MAP4K4 ligands, we have also provided 95% confidence intervals through bootstrapping with replacement. This allows us to assess the statistical significance of the correlations and to compare the performance of different methods more meaningfully.

In terms of statistical significance, our results indicate that some methods achieve correlations that are statistically significant. For instance, the ECFP6 and RDKit 2D QSAR regression models show statistically significant correlations, although they do not outperform the structure-based methods. Additionally, the neural net model trained on the reduced set achieves the highest Spearman correlation coefficient for HSP90 ligands, but the correlation is not particularly high and is only marginally better than the dataset’s correlation with molecular weight.

For the MAP4K4 dataset, the small number of compounds with reported activities makes it challenging to draw definitive conclusions. However, the 95% confidence intervals provide insight into the variability and reliability of the results. Interestingly, scoring the pose with the closest RMSD to the crystal ligand did not result in improved correlations, suggesting that the scoring function's top-ranked pose is already a good predictor of affinity.

Overall, while some methods show statistically significant performance, the differences between methods are often subtle. The inclusion of confidence intervals helps to contextualize these differences and to avoid overstating the superiority of any single method."

For the antimalarial data set, we utilized 50 known antimalarial hits, while for the dual A2AAR/MAO-B ligands, we used eight known dual-target ligands. Decoy molecules for these datasets were generated using the DUD-E server and the DecoyFinder application. The structures of these compounds, along with their biological annotations, are provided in the supplemental information online.

The data preparation involved compiling, curating, and codifying these compounds through molecular descriptors using the ISIDA Fragmentor software. The top 250 most informative descriptors, selected based on higher relevance and lower redundancy using the mRMR algorithm, were used for modeling.

The datasets were divided into training, test, external, and virtual screening (VS) validation sets. The training set was used to build base models, while the test set evaluated their performance. The external set verified the predictive capability of the selected models, and the VS validation sets assessed the virtual screening performance. The composition of these sets is summarized in the supplemental information online.

The antimalarial dataset included compounds targeting the 3D7 and W2 strains, as well as a toxicity endpoint (Huh7). For the dual A2AAR/MAO-B ligands, the dataset focused on compounds targeting A2AAR and MAO-B. The performance of the base models varied, with better results observed for the toxicity endpoint in the antimalarial dataset and for MAO-B inhibitors in the dual-target dataset. This variation can be attributed to the structural diversity of the datasets, with the dual-target dataset being less diverse, making it easier to identify bioactivity rules.

In total, 1001 base models were trained for each endpoint in each dataset, with performance metrics summarized in the supplemental information. The best models were selected based on the maximum balanced classification rate (BCR) achieved for the test set.

The training set was used to build the base models, while the test set was employed to evaluate their performance and select the best models. The external dataset was reserved solely for verifying the predictive capability of the selected models, ensuring that it did not influence the model selection process. This independence was crucial for assessing the generalizability of the models.

To enforce the independence of the training and test sets, careful curation and splitting strategies were employed. The datasets were designed to include a diverse range of compounds, ensuring that the models were not overfitted to specific subsets of data. The structural diversity of the datasets played a significant role in this process. For instance, the dual A2AAR/MAO-B ligands dataset was less structurally diverse compared to the antimalarial dataset, which affected the applicability domain of the models. This diversity influenced the ease of discovering bioactivity rules during the machine learning process.

The distribution of the datasets compares favorably with previously published machine learning datasets in the field.

This includes the SD files containing compound structures and biological annotations for each set. Additionally, lists of the final subset of 250 ISIDA Fragments per endpoint are available. The composition of all these sets is summarized in Table S1 in the supplemental information.

The supplemental information also includes Table S2, which summarizes the performance metrics of the base classifiers. For the antimalarial compounds, models for the toxicity endpoint (Huh7) showed better average performances compared to those for antimalarial endpoints (3D7 and W2). In the case of dual A2AAR/MAO-B ligands, the best performance was achieved for MAO-B inhibitors. The performance of the base models was generally higher for the dual A2AAR/MAO-B ligands due to the lower structural diversity of this dataset, which made it easier to discover the rules guiding bioactivity.

The selection of the best models was based on the maximum value of the balanced classification rate (BCR) achieved for the test set. The external dataset was used solely for verifying the predictive capability of the selected models and did not influence the model selection process.

Different strategies were employed for combining base models into ensembles for each endpoint. For antimalarial activity endpoints (3D7 and W2), the best-performing ensemble used a genetic algorithm (GA) to select base models and the scores vote (SV) aggregation strategy to maximize BCR. For the toxicity endpoint (Huh7), the best ensemble used majority vote (MV) aggregation and minimized the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). For dual A2AAR/MAO-B ligands, the best ensembles used Borda vote (BV) and majority vote (MV) for A2AAR and MAO-B, respectively, to maximize BCR.

The obtained ensembles improved the average performance of the base models for all endpoints, as shown in Figure 4. The ensembles also demonstrated a better balance between sensitivity and specificity compared to the base models. The ensembles contained between 5 and 14 base models, representing approximately 1% of the total number of base models. This highlights the importance of combining a tailored subset of diverse base models rather than aggregating a large number of models.

The external dataset was used to assess the predictive potential of the ensembles, ensuring that the ensembles can generate trustworthy score values for compounds within their applicability domain. The final ensembles for all endpoints, except for MAO-B inhibitors, contained all compounds of the VS validation sets within their applicability domains.

PMC5650527	optimization/algorithm	LSSVM	"The optimization algorithm employed in our work leverages ensemble modeling techniques, specifically utilizing Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM) as the base classification algorithm. LSSVM is a well-established machine-learning algorithm class within the realm of support vector machines, known for its efficiency in handling classification problems.

The approach is not entirely new but is innovative in its application to drug discovery. The novelty lies in the integration of LSSVM with a desirability-based method for multi-criteria virtual screening, which is tailored for drug discovery processes. This method involves transforming classification scores into desirability values, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of compounds based on multiple criteria.

The reason this work was published in a drug discovery journal rather than a machine-learning journal is due to the specific focus on its application in pharmaceutical research. The primary contribution is the development of a nature-inspired multi-criteria optimization process for drug discovery, which includes the use of ensemble modeling and the applicability domain. The method's suitability is demonstrated through case studies in drug discovery, making it more relevant to the field of pharmaceutical research.

The ensemble models are constructed using diverse base models, selected through strategies like clustering and Genetic Algorithms (GA). The diversity of these base models is crucial for the performance of the ensemble, ensuring that the final model can handle a wide range of chemical spaces.

PMC5650527	optimization/meta	Yes: model aggregation (ensemble modeling) and multi-criteria decision making Trained on the same dataset	"The model described in this publication employs an ensemble modeling approach, which can be considered a form of meta-predictor. This approach utilizes data from multiple base machine-learning algorithms as input. Specifically, a pool of diverse base classification models is trained for each endpoint using the Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM) classification algorithm. These base models are then aggregated into ensemble models using three different data fusion strategies: Major vote (MV), Borda vote (BV), and Scores vote (SV).

The diversity of the base models is ensured through a random features subset selection strategy, where each base model can contain several descriptors ranging from 5 to 25. The applicability domain of the base models is defined according to the molecular descriptors range method, ensuring that each feature included in the model is used to build a hyper-rectangle defined by the maximum and minimum values of the features on the training data.

The ensemble models are designed to improve the performance of the best base model for all endpoints and to provide a better balance between sensitivity and specificity. The selection of the best ensemble is based on the maximum value of the Balanced Classification Rate (BCR) achieved for the test set. The external data set is used only to assess the predictive potential of the models, ensuring that the training data is independent and that the models can generate trustworthy score values within their applicability domain.

In summary, the model is a meta-predictor that combines the outputs of multiple LSSVM base models using different aggregation strategies.

Initially, a dataset of chemical compounds was compiled, curated, and codified using molecular descriptors. These descriptors were calculated using the ISIDA Fragmentor software, which is freely available. The top 250 most informative descriptors, those with higher relevance and lower redundancy, were selected using the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) algorithm. This selection process ensured that the descriptors used were both informative and non-redundant, providing a robust foundation for the subsequent modeling steps.

The molecular descriptors were then used to train a pool of diverse base classification models for each endpoint. To ensure diversity among the base models, a random features subset selection strategy was employed. Each base model could contain between 5 to 25 descriptors. The acceptability of a base model was determined by its accuracy in predicting the training and test sets, as well as in fivefold cross-validation experiments. A model was considered acceptable if it achieved an accuracy of at least 0.65. This rigorous selection process ensured that only high-performing models were included in the ensemble.

The applicability domain of the base models was defined using the molecular descriptors range method. This method involves creating a hyper-rectangle defined by the maximum and minimum values of the features in the training data. A sample was considered within the applicability domain if it fell within this hyper-rectangle. This approach ensured that predictions were made only for samples that were within the scope of the training data, enhancing the reliability of the model's predictions.

In summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved the selection of informative molecular descriptors, the training of diverse base models, and the definition of an applicability domain to ensure reliable predictions.

The parameters are the properties or endpoints that are considered for the optimization of compounds. These can include various molecular properties, biological activities, or other relevant descriptors.

The selection of parameters is guided by the goals of the project and the reliability of the measures. In practice, the number of parameters can vary, but it is important to note that as the number of properties being optimized increases, the number of optimal compounds also increases exponentially. This can become impractical when considering more than approximately four properties. Therefore, the selection of parameters is a crucial step that involves balancing the need for comprehensive optimization with the practical limitations of the method.

In some cases, ensemble modeling is used to handle a larger number of parameters effectively. This approach involves combining multiple base models to improve performance and robustness. The diversity of the base models is ensured through strategies such as clustering or genetic algorithms, which help in selecting a tailored subset of models that provide the best balance between sensitivity and specificity.

The applicability domain of the ensemble models is defined as the union of the applicability domains of the individual models, which increases the overall applicability domain. This ensures that the model can handle a wider range of compounds and provides more reliable predictions.

The ensembles we constructed comprised a tailored subset of base models, ensuring a certain level of diversity. This diversity is crucial because it allows the ensemble to capture a broader range of patterns in the data, reducing the risk of overfitting that can occur when a single model becomes too complex and fits the noise in the training data.

To rule out overfitting, we optimized the performance of our ensembles on a separate test set, ensuring that the improvements in performance were not merely due to memorizing the training data. Additionally, the ensembles showed a better balance between sensitivity and specificity compared to the base models, indicating that they generalize well to unseen data.

The ensembles also covered a significant portion of the chemical space, as evidenced by their applicability domain, which included nearly all samples in the validation sets. This extensive coverage suggests that the models are not underfitting, as they are capable of making predictions across a wide range of compounds.

Furthermore, the use of desirability functions in our multi-criteria optimization process allowed us to handle missing values and data uncertainty effectively. This feature ensures that the models are robust and can provide reliable predictions even when some data points are incomplete or uncertain.

In summary, the combination of ensemble modeling, optimization on a test set, and the use of desirability functions helps to address both overfitting and underfitting, ensuring that our models are both complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data and generalizable to new, unseen compounds."

The ensembles we developed were optimized on the test set, ensuring that the improvements in performance did not come at the expense of the training set statistics. This careful balancing act helped in maintaining the model's generalizability and preventing overfitting to the training data.

Additionally, we considered the applicability domain of the models, which is dynamically structured throughout the modeling process. This ensures that the models are reliable and trustworthy within the chemical space they are designed to cover. By focusing on a tailored subset of base models that encompass a certain level of diversity, we avoided the pitfalls of using an excessively large number of models, which could lead to overfitting.

While individual base models, such as Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM), may not be fully transparent, the ensemble approach provides several layers of interpretability.

Firstly, the diversity of base models ensures that the ensemble captures a wide range of patterns in the data. This diversity is achieved through the use of different subsets of molecular descriptors and various aggregation strategies, such as Major Vote (MV), Borda Vote (BV), and Scores Vote (SV). The use of these strategies allows for a more robust and generalizable model, as the ensemble can leverage the strengths of individual models while mitigating their weaknesses.

Secondly, the applicability domain of the ensemble models is defined as the union of the applicability domains of the individual base models. This means that the ensemble can provide predictions for a broader range of compounds, and the contribution of each base model to the final prediction is clearly defined. Only base models that include a sample within their applicability domain contribute to the aggregated decision, making the prediction process more transparent.

Additionally, the transformation of classification scores into desirability values adds another layer of interpretability. This transformation is based on the highest and lowest scores predicted by the ensemble across all training, test, and external sets. Compounds with higher scores are considered more desirable, and this desirability can be directly linked to the biological activity of the compounds.

Furthermore, the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) for selecting base models and optimizing their aggregation ensures that the ensemble is tailored to maximize performance metrics such as the Balanced Classification Rate (BCR). This optimization process is guided by clear fitness functions and distance metrics, providing a transparent framework for model selection and aggregation.

In summary, while the individual base models may not be fully transparent, the ensemble approach provides a structured and interpretable framework for model development and prediction.

These base models are aggregated into ensemble models using different data fusion strategies, such as Major vote, Borda vote, and Scores vote. The final output of the model is a classification score that is transformed into a desirability value, indicating the likelihood of a compound being active or inactive.

The performance of the ensemble models is evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and the Balanced Classification Rate (BCR).

PMC5650527	evaluation/method	Independent dataset	"The evaluation of the proposed methodology involved a comprehensive approach to ensure its robustness and suitability for virtual screening (VS) campaigns. Three distinct virtual screening validation sets (VSVS) were designed for this purpose. The first VSVS, referred to as VSVS-1, included known active compounds and decoys generated using the DUD-E server. This set was used to optimize the individual desirability weights, which were then aggregated into the final multicriteria VS tool.

To further validate the methodology, two additional VSVS were constructed: VSVS-2 and VSVS-3. These sets included a second subset of known active compounds and decoys generated using both the DUD-E server and the DecoyFinder application. The classification scores for these VSVS were computed and transformed into desirability values according to previously established transformations.

The evaluation focused on the initial enrichment of active compounds within the first 1% of screened data, which is crucial for the efficiency of VS campaigns. The results demonstrated a significant initial enrichment of active compounds, even at very low fractions of screened data. This observation was consistent across all experiments, including the worst-performing VS validation experiments.

The performance of the desirability-based methodology was compared to the aggregation of classification scores without transforming them into desirabilities. The desirability-based approach showed superior initial enrichment, highlighting its advantages for multicriteria VS. The optimization of weights for the aggregation of individual desirability functions provided only a slight improvement, indicating that weight optimization is not necessarily mandatory for obtaining effective VS tools.

The evaluation also included an analysis of the applicability domain of the ensemble models. The ensemble models covered a broader region of the chemical space compared to individual models, ensuring that the predictions are reliable for compounds within their applicability domain. This was particularly evident in the case of MAO-B inhibitors, where the ensemble model increased the coverage of the chemical space by approximately 13% relative to the individual model average.

Overall, the evaluation methodology involved a rigorous assessment using multiple VSVS and a comparison with alternative approaches. The results strongly support the hypothesis that desirability functions can be effectively used for the development of high-performance multicriteria VS tools."

BCR is defined as the average of sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp), providing a balanced measure of a model's performance, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. This metric is crucial because it ensures that models with a good balance between true positive and true negative rates are favored.

In addition to BCR, we also considered other performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate our models. These include sensitivity, specificity, and overall classification accuracy. Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model, while specificity measures the proportion of actual negatives correctly identified. Classification accuracy provides an overall measure of the model's correctness.

The use of BCR as our primary metric is representative of current practices in the field, as it addresses the common issue of imbalanced datasets in biological and chemical data. By focusing on BCR, we ensure that our models are robust and generalizable, providing reliable predictions across different datasets and endpoints.

Moreover, we evaluated the performance of our ensemble models compared to individual base models. The ensemble models consistently showed improved performance metrics, indicating that the combination of diverse base models enhances predictive accuracy and reliability. This approach is in line with established methods in machine learning and cheminformatics, where ensemble techniques are widely used to improve model performance.

In summary, our choice of performance metrics is both comprehensive and representative of current standards in the field. By focusing on BCR and additional metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, we ensure that our models are thoroughly evaluated and capable of providing reliable predictions for virtual screening and other applications."

PMC5650527	evaluation/comparison	No	"In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, our focus was on evaluating the performance of our ensemble modeling approach and the desirability-based methodology within the context of our specific datasets—antimalarial compounds and dual A2AAR/MAO-B ligands.

However, we did compare the performance of our ensemble models to simpler baselines, such as the average performance of the base models and the best individual base model. The ensemble models consistently showed better performance than these baselines across all endpoints. This improvement was evident in both the average performance metrics and the balance between sensitivity and specificity.

Additionally, we evaluated the virtual screening (VS) performance of our approach using three different VS Validation Sets (VSVS). These sets were designed to assess the ability of our models to retrieve known active compounds from a pool of decoys. The results demonstrated that our desirability-based methodology outperformed the simple aggregation of classification scores, particularly in the early fractions of screened data.

While we did not compare our methods to other publicly available tools directly, the internal comparisons and the use of diverse validation sets provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of our approach. The ensemble modeling strategy and the desirability-based methodology showed significant improvements over simpler baselines, highlighting their potential for high-performance multicriteria virtual screening."

PMC5821114	dataset/provenance	The data comes from a direct experiment. They consider firing rates of ~200 ganglion cells.	"The dataset used in our study was sourced from recordings of the isolated salamander retina. We recorded the spike trains of approximately 200 ganglion cells while stimulating the photoreceptor layer with a spatially and temporally rich display consisting of an array of vertical bars that flickered randomly and independently at 60 Hz. This stimulus was designed to drive a wide range of spatio-temporal computations in the retina while limiting the complexity of analysis and modeling by restricting it to one spatial dimension.

The dataset included repeated presentations of the same flicker sequence, which reliably evoked very similar spike trains, suggesting that essential features of the retina’s light response could be captured by a deterministic model of the ganglion cell and its input circuitry. Additionally, we presented a long non-repeating flicker sequence to explore as many spatio-temporal patterns as possible. Thirty ganglion cells were selected for quantitative modeling based on the stability of their responses throughout the extended recording period.

The data used in this study is novel and has not been previously published or used by the community. It was specifically collected for the purpose of testing our modeling approach for inferring the structure of neural circuits from sparse physiological recordings. The dataset provides a comprehensive set of recordings that allowed us to develop and validate our models, making specific predictions for the response properties and connectivity of bipolar cells, which were subsequently confirmed by direct physiological recordings."

The training set consisted of approximately 80% of the data, which was used to optimize the parameters of the models. The test set, comprising the remaining 20% of the data, was used to evaluate the performance of the models. This split allowed for a comprehensive assessment of the models' ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

The training set included a long stretch of non-repeating flicker sequences, which provided a rich variety of spatio-temporal patterns. This diversity was crucial for capturing the essential features of the retina's light response. The test set, on the other hand, consisted of repeated presentations of the same flicker sequence. This repetition ensured that the models could reliably predict the responses of ganglion cells to familiar stimuli, thereby validating their performance.

The distribution of data points in each split was designed to ensure that the models were trained on a wide range of conditions and could be tested under consistent and controlled circumstances. This approach helped in achieving a robust and reliable evaluation of the models' predictive capabilities."	Tie_High		2026-02-09T18:05:07.788248

(to predict firing rates of ganglion cells)	"The optimization algorithm employed in our study falls under the class of high-dimensional parameter search methods. This approach is not novel in the field of machine learning but is particularly well-suited for our specific application in neural circuit modeling. The algorithm's primary function is to optimize the parameters of our cascade models to best fit the experimental data obtained from ganglion cell recordings.

The choice of this algorithm is driven by the need to handle a large number of parameters efficiently. Our models, particularly the more complex ones like the linear-nonlinear-sum-nonlinear (LNSN) model, involve numerous parameters that describe the spatio-temporal filters, nonlinearities, and pooling weights. The algorithm systematically adjusts these parameters to maximize the explained variance in the ganglion cell firing rates, ensuring that the models accurately predict the visual responses.

The reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that its development and application are deeply rooted in the biological context of retinal circuitry. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through its ability to infer biologically plausible structures and dynamics within the retina, rather than through abstract performance metrics. The focus of our work is on the biological insights gained from the modeling process, which are subsequently validated through experimental measurements. This interdisciplinary approach highlights the algorithm's practical utility in neuroscience rather than its theoretical novelty in machine learning."	Tie_High		2026-02-09T18:06:35.695044

PMC5821114	optimization/encoding	Not stated.	"The data encoding process focused on predicting the firing rate of ganglion cells, specifically the expected number of spikes fired in any given 1/60 second interval. The input to the models was the time course of the flicker stimulus, which was used to produce a time course of the firing rate as output. The data was divided into a training set, consisting of approximately 80% of the data with non-repeating flicker, and a test set, consisting of the remaining 20% with repeated flicker. This division allowed for the optimization of model parameters on the training set and the evaluation of model performance on the test set.

The models used were cascade models, which are networks of simple elements involving either linear filtering or static nonlinear transforms. These models map naturally onto neural circuitry and can be adjusted from coarse-grained to fine-grained versions. The initial model used was the linear-nonlinear (LN) model, which consists of a single linear-nonlinear cascade. This model was able to approximate the ganglion cell output but had limitations in accurately predicting firing events.

To improve the model, a sequence of four cascade models was created by systematically adding components to the circuits. Each model derived its name from the cascade of components, with the final model being the linear-nonlinear-feedback-delayed-sum-nonlinear-feedback (LNFDSNF) model. For each model class, the components of the circuit were parameterized, and the fitting algorithm found the optimal parameter values for each ganglion cell. The improvement in model performance was not due to overfitting but rather to the models capturing additional aspects of the computations carried out by the retina. The models were evaluated using separate training and testing data, achieving equivalent values in the explained variance, which implies that each model truly captures additional aspects of the computations carried out by the retina."

PMC5821114	optimization/parameters	~100-150 parameters	"In our study, the number of parameters used in the models varied depending on the specific model structure. The simplest model, the LN model, had the most free parameters, totaling 186. This included 185 parameters in the linear filter, with 31 spatial positions, each having a 6-parameter temporal filter, and 1 parameter in the nonlinearity.

For the more complex models, such as the LNSN, LNSNF, and LNFSNF models, the number of free parameters was reduced to 68. This reduction was achieved by imposing a structure guided by known retinal anatomy, which provided a constraint that regularized the optimization process.

The LNFDSNF model, the most complex model we tested, had 108 free parameters. This model included delays inserted between each BCM and the GCM, which were allowed to vary independently for each BCM.

The selection of the number of parameters was guided by the goal of balancing model complexity with biological realism. We aimed to create models that were complex enough to capture the essential features of the retinal circuitry but not so complex that they were computationally intractable or overfitted to the data. The models were systematically refined by adding components to the circuits, and the performance of each model was evaluated to ensure that it significantly outperformed the previous one. This approach allowed us to determine which plausible neural circuit best explained the functional data."	B_Better		2026-02-09T18:08:07.348380
PMC5821114	optimization/features	Not stated.	"The input features for our models are derived from the time course of the flicker stimulus. Specifically, the models take the temporal dynamics of the flicker stimulus as input to predict the firing rate of ganglion cells. The stimulus is presented in intervals of 1/60 seconds, which means the input features are essentially the stimulus intensities at these discrete time points.

Feature selection, in the traditional sense, was not performed. Instead, the models are designed to capture the relevant temporal patterns directly from the stimulus data. The models are structured to include various components that process these input features, such as linear filters and nonlinear transformations, which together allow the models to extract meaningful patterns from the stimulus.

The optimization process involved using a training set, which constituted approximately 80% of the data, to fit the models. This training set was used to maximize the fraction of variance in the firing rate that the models explain. The remaining 20% of the data, referred to as the test set, was used to evaluate the model performance. This separation ensures that the models are not overfitted to the training data and can generalize well to new, unseen data."	B_Better		2026-02-09T18:08:26.410195
PMC5821114	optimization/fitting	Fitting is performed but the fitting algorithm is not explained.	"The fitting method employed in our study involved a careful balance to avoid both over-fitting and under-fitting. The models constructed were cascade models, which are networks of simple elements involving linear filtering and static nonlinear transforms. These models were designed to map the time course of the flicker stimulus to the firing rate of ganglion cells.

To address the concern of over-fitting, we used separate training and testing datasets. The training set consisted of approximately 80% of the data, which was non-repeating flicker, while the test set consisted of the remaining 20%, which was repeated flicker. The model parameters were optimized to fit the training set, and the performance was then evaluated on the test set. This approach ensured that the model's performance was not merely a result of memorizing the training data but rather reflected its ability to generalize to new data.

Additionally, the models were systematically constructed by adding components guided by known retinal anatomy. This structured approach provided constraints that regularized the optimization process, helping to avoid the ""curse of dimensionality"" often associated with high-dimensional parameter spaces. For instance, the linear-nonlinear-sum-nonlinear (LNSN) model, which included multiple bipolar cell modules, achieved better performance despite having fewer free parameters than the simpler linear-nonlinear (LN) model. This indicates that the added complexity was justified and did not lead to over-fitting.

To rule out under-fitting, we tracked the performance metric across successive changes in the model structure. Each new model was more general than the previous one and significantly outperformed it in predicting the visual responses of certain ganglion cells. This progressive improvement in performance across models of increasing complexity suggests that the models were capturing additional aspects of the computations carried out by the retina, rather than being too simplistic to capture the underlying processes.

In summary, the fitting method involved using separate training and testing datasets, adding components guided by known anatomy, and tracking performance metrics across model structures. These steps ensured that the models were neither over-fitted nor under-fitted, providing a robust and biologically plausible representation of the retinal circuitry."

PMC5821114	optimization/regularization	"yes. A ""fitting algorithm"" is mentioned but the technique is not explained."	"In our modeling approach, we employed several techniques to prevent over-fitting and ensure that our models generalized well to new data. One key method involved imposing a structure guided by known anatomy of the retina. By using repeating identical subunits from bipolar cells, we provided a constraint that regularized the optimization process. This anatomical guidance helped to circumvent the ""curse of dimensionality"" in model fitting, which is a common issue when dealing with high-dimensional data.

Additionally, we used separate training and testing datasets. The models were optimized on a long stretch of non-repeating flicker data (the training set, comprising about 80% of the data), and their performance was evaluated on the remaining data examined with repeated flicker (the test set, about 20%). This approach ensured that the models' performance metrics were tracked across successive changes in the model structure, providing a robust evaluation of their predictive power.

Furthermore, we systematically added components to the circuit models, creating a sequence of increasingly complex models. Each model was more general than the previous one and significantly outperformed it in predicting the visual responses of certain ganglion cells. Importantly, the improvement in performance was not simply due to over-fitting after the addition of more free parameters. In fact, the linear-nonlinear (LN) model, which had the most free parameters among the models tested, did not always perform the best. This indicates that each model truly captured additional aspects of the computations carried out by the retina, rather than just fitting noise in the data."

We employed cascade models, which are networks of simple elements involving either linear filtering or static nonlinear transforms. These models map naturally onto neural circuitry, allowing us to draw direct parallels between the model components and known biological structures.

One of the key aspects of our models is their alignment with retinal anatomy. For instance, the linear-nonlinear-sum-nonlinear (LNSN) model consists of multiple ""bipolar cell-like"" modules, each representing a miniature linear-nonlinear (LN) model. These modules are identical but placed at different spatial locations in the retina. Their outputs are weighted, pooled together, and rectified by a ganglion cell module (GCM). This structure provides a clear interpretation: the bipolar cell modules (BCMs) correspond to real biological bipolar cells, and the GCM represents the ganglion cell's pooling and rectification processes.

The spatio-temporal filters of the BCMs match existing measurements of bipolar cell receptive fields, exhibiting a ""Mexican hat"" shape in the spatial domain and specific kinetics in the time domain. This alignment with experimental data indicates that the BCMs are not arbitrary components but reflect actual biological properties. Similarly, the pooling weights of the GCM attain a center-surround structure at a larger scale, comparable to the spatial extent of ganglion cell dendritic fields. This distinction between the spatial pooling properties of the outer retina (BCM component) and the inner retina (GCM) is another example of how our models provide interpretable insights into retinal processing.

Moreover, the models' performance improvements with added complexity are not due to overfitting. Each model captures additional aspects of retinal computations, as evidenced by their better prediction of visual responses and the biological realism of their components. For example, the introduction of feedback in the linear-nonlinear-feedback-sum-nonlinear-feedback (LNFSNF) model significantly improves performance, indicating the importance of feedback mechanisms in retinal processing.

In summary, our models are transparent and interpretable, with components that correspond to known biological structures and functions. This interpretability allows us to gain insights into the computations carried out by the retina and to make testable predictions about bipolar cell physiology."

PMC5821114	model/output	The model gives as output the neuron's spike rate (time course of the firing rate).	"The model developed in our study is primarily a regression model. It is designed to predict the firing rate of ganglion cells (GCs), which is the expected number of spikes fired in any given time interval, typically 1/60 seconds. The model takes the time course of a flicker stimulus as input and produces a time course of the firing rate as output. The parameters of the model are optimized to fit the data, specifically by maximizing the fraction of variance in the firing rate that the model explains. This approach is characteristic of regression models, where the goal is to predict a continuous output variable based on input data.

The models we constructed are cascade models, which involve a sequence of linear filtering and nonlinear transformations. These models map naturally onto neural circuitry and can be adjusted to different levels of detail, from coarse-grained representations to fine-grained, multi-compartment models. The cascade structure allows for the incorporation of biological details such as neurons, axons, synapses, and dendrites, making the model both biologically plausible and mathematically tractable.

We started with a simple linear-nonlinear (LN) model and systematically added components to create more complex models, such as the linear-nonlinear-feedback-delayed-sum-nonlinear-feedback (LNFDSNF) model. Each model was optimized to fit the data, and the performance of each model was evaluated on a separate test set to ensure that the improvements were not due to overfitting. The models were able to capture additional aspects of the computations carried out by the retina, providing a more accurate prediction of the visual responses of ganglion cells.

In summary, the models we developed are regression models that predict the firing rate of ganglion cells based on the input stimulus. The cascade structure of the models allows for the incorporation of biological details and provides a powerful tool for inferring the inner details of a neural circuit from simulation and fitting of its overall performance."

"The evaluation method involved a progressive extension of the model complexity, starting from a linear-nonlinear (LN) model and advancing to a linear-nonlinear-feedback-delayed-sum-nonlinear-feedback (LNFDSNF) model. Each model's performance was assessed by its ability to predict ganglion cell (GC) firing rates in response to randomly flickering bar stimuli. The models were trained on approximately 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%, ensuring that performance metrics were not merely a result of overfitting.

The explained variance, which measures the fraction of variance in the firing rate that the model explains, was used as the primary performance metric. This metric was tracked across successive changes in the model structure, demonstrating that each model captured additional aspects of the computations carried out by the retina.

Experimental tests were conducted to validate the biological realism of the models. These tests involved measuring the receptive and projective fields of real bipolar cells (BCs) and comparing them to their predicted counterparts in the models. The experiments combined sharp electrode recordings from BCs and multi-electrode array recordings from GCs, allowing for the identification of projection patterns from BCs to GCs. The data selection for model fitting was done before fitting to avoid biasing the results.

The LNFDSNF model, in particular, showed a significant improvement in performance, achieving an 8% increase in explained variance. This model's ability to delay the receptive field surround independently of other circuit elements was crucial in accommodating the delayed receptive field surround observed in GCs. The experimental data supported the model's predictions, indicating that the inferred elements in the fitting process have actual biological counterparts."

PMC5821114	evaluation/measure	Not stated.	"In our study, we focused on evaluating the performance of various models in predicting the firing rate of ganglion cells. The primary metric we used was the explained variance (E.V.), which quantifies the fraction of variance in the firing rate that each model explains. This metric was chosen because it provides a clear indication of how well each model approximates the actual neural responses.

We reported the explained variance for individual cells across different models, presenting both the mean and the interquartile range to show the variability in performance. This allowed us to compare the effectiveness of each model in capturing the neural responses. Additionally, we plotted the variance explained by each model as a ratio to the variance explained by the simplest model, the LN model. This ratio helped to highlight the improvements in performance as more complex features were added to the models.

The models we evaluated included the LN model, which served as a baseline, and more complex models such as LNSN, LNSNF, LNFSNF, and LNFDSNF. Each of these models introduced additional components to the circuit, such as nonlinearities and feedback mechanisms, which significantly improved the explained variance. For instance, the introduction of a nonlinearity at the bipolar cell output and the addition of feedback mechanisms showed substantial jumps in performance.

Our approach to evaluating model performance is representative of standard practices in sensory neuroscience. The use of explained variance as a performance metric is common in the field, as it provides a straightforward way to assess how well a model captures the variability in neural responses. By comparing the performance of our models to the LN model, we were able to demonstrate the incremental improvements achieved by adding more complex features. This method allows for a clear and comparative evaluation of model performance, making our results interpretable and comparable to other studies in the literature."

The study began with a reference point model known as the Linear-Nonlinear (LN) model, which is a common starting point in sensory neuroscience. This model consists of a single linear-nonlinear cascade and was used to approximate the output of ganglion cells. However, it was found that the LN model often predicted firing at inappropriate times, resulting in wider and flatter firing events than observed.

To improve upon this, a sequence of four cascade models was created by systematically adding components to the circuits. Each subsequent model derived its name from the cascade of components added. The most complex model developed was the Linear-Nonlinear-Feedback-Delayed-Sum-Nonlinear-Feedback (LNFDSNF) model. For each model class, the components of the circuit were parameterized, and the fitting algorithm found the optimal parameter values for each ganglion cell.

"The performance metrics used in our study include explained variance, which is presented with median values and interquartile ranges. This provides a sense of the confidence intervals around the performance of each model. For instance, the explained variance for different models like LN, LNSN, LNSNF, LNFSNF, and LNFDSNF are given with their respective interquartile ranges, indicating the variability and reliability of these metrics.

Statistical significance is a crucial aspect of our analysis. We employed sign tests to compare the performance across different models and corresponding experimental data. The results show that each model significantly outperforms the previous one in predicting the visual responses of certain ganglion cells, with p-values less than 0.001 for every step. This statistical rigor ensures that the improvements in model performance are not due to overfitting but rather capture additional aspects of the computations carried out by the retina.

Additionally, the experimental tests confirm the biological realism of the models. For example, the spatial characteristics of the bipolar cell module (BCM) filters matched well with the measured bipolar cell receptive fields, and the projective weights quantified from current injections into bipolar cells aligned with the model predictions. These findings further bolster the confidence in the superiority of our method over baselines."

PMC5910428	dataset/provenance	"The authors used structures in PDB as the main data source.
They clustered the structures based on different sequence identity thresholds. The resulted structure dataset consists of:
10173 (30% sequence identity), 14064 (50% sequence identity), and 17607 structures (90% sequence identity)."	"The dataset used in this study was sourced from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a well-known repository of protein structures. High-resolution protein structures were collected using specific filtering conditions, including structure determination method, resolution, chain length, and sequence identity. These conditions ensured that the dataset was of high quality and suitable for training the neural network.

Three datasets were prepared based on different sequence identity cutoffs: 30%, 50%, and 90%. These cutoffs were used to remove homologous proteins, ensuring that the datasets were diverse and representative of different protein structures. For each dataset, clusters were created by extracting each residue and its closest neighbor residues based on the Cα-Cα distance. The number of neighbor residues considered varied (N = 10, 15, 20, 25, 30), and these clusters were randomly split into five sets for five-fold cross-validation.

The datasets were named according to the sequence identity cutoff and the number of neighbor residues. For example, SI30N10 refers to the dataset with a 30% sequence identity cutoff and 10 neighbor residues. Similar naming conventions were applied to other datasets.

The number of data samples varied across the datasets. For instance, the number of data samples almost doubled from the SI30 dataset to the SI90 dataset. This increase in data samples contributed to the improved accuracy observed in datasets with higher protein identity cutoffs.

The datasets used in this study were compared with those used in previous work, such as the SPIN method developed by Zhou and coworkers. SPIN was trained on 1532 non-redundant proteins with a sequence identity cutoff of 30%. In contrast, the current study used a significantly larger number of data samples, which allowed for more robust training and better performance.

The datasets were used to train a neural network for predicting the probability of 20 natural amino acids at each residue in a protein. The neural network architecture included a residue probability network, a weight network, and fully-connected layers leading to a 20-dimensional softmax layer. The input features for the network included basic geometric and structural properties of the residues, such as Cα-Cα distance, backbone dihedrals, secondary structures, hydrogen bonds, and solvent accessible surface area.

In summary, the dataset was sourced from the PDB, with high-resolution protein structures filtered based on specific conditions. Three datasets were created with different sequence identity cutoffs, and clusters were formed by considering neighbor residues. The datasets were used to train a neural network, and the number of data samples varied across the datasets, contributing to the overall accuracy of the predictions."

PMC5910428	dataset/splits	"For training the model, the authors used a random split 5-fold cross-validation.
The proportion of training and test data points used in cross-validation was not reported."	The dataset was divided into five splits for the purpose of five-fold cross-validation. Each split contained a random selection of clusters, which consisted of a target residue and its neighboring residues. The number of data samples in each split is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that the datasets were prepared based on three sequence identity cutoffs: 30%, 50%, and 90%. For each of these datasets, the number of neighbor residues considered was varied (N = 10, 15, 20, 25, 30). The specific naming convention used for the datasets is SI30N10, SI50N15, etc., where the first part indicates the sequence identity cutoff and the second part indicates the number of neighbor residues. The distribution of data points in each split is not detailed, but it is implied that the splits were designed to be representative of the overall dataset.	Tie_High		2026-02-09T18:17:28.792281
PMC5910428	dataset/redundancy	The authors trained their model on 3 redundancy-reduced datasets with 3 different sequence identity thresholds (30%, 50%, and 90%).	"The datasets used in our study were prepared based on three sequence identity cutoffs: 30%, 50%, and 90%. These cutoffs were applied to remove homologous proteins and ensure that the datasets were independent. For each sequence identity cutoff, structures were retrieved with the specified sequence identity, and additional filters were applied to remove membrane proteins, structures with D-amino acids, and non-protein residues. The resulting datasets consisted of structures with varying sequence identities.

To ensure the independence of the training and test sets, the datasets were randomly split into five sets for five-fold cross-validation. This means that each dataset was divided into five parts, and the model was trained and tested five times, each time using a different part as the test set and the remaining four parts as the training set. This approach helps to ensure that the model's performance is evaluated on independent data and that the results are not due to overfitting.

The distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of protein design. The datasets used in our study are larger and more diverse than many previously published datasets, which helps to improve the model's performance and generalization to new data. The use of high-resolution protein structures and the application of strict filtering criteria also help to ensure the quality and reliability of the datasets."	B_Better		2026-02-09T23:57:40.721631

By controlling the distribution, the authors can also provide guidance on the proper use of the datasets, ensuring that the research is conducted ethically and accurately.

PMC5910428	optimization/algorithm	The algorithm used is a classic neural network. 	"The optimization algorithm employed in our study is a deep learning neural network, specifically constructed using the Keras library. This approach falls under the class of supervised learning algorithms, where the network is trained to predict the probability of 20 natural amino acids for each residue in a protein.

The neural network utilized is not entirely novel; it leverages established techniques in deep learning. The choice of using a deep learning neural network was driven by its proven effectiveness in handling large datasets and extracting complex features, which is particularly relevant given the increasing number of solved protein structures.

The decision to publish this work in a scientific journal rather than a machine-learning journal is rooted in the application domain. The primary focus of our research is on computational protein design, which has significant implications in biology, chemistry, and medicine. While the deep learning techniques used are well-known in the machine-learning community, their application to protein design is what sets this work apart. The integration of deep learning with protein design methods represents a novel contribution to the field of computational biology, making it more appropriate for publication in a scientific journal that caters to a broader audience interested in protein engineering and related applications."

PMC5910428	optimization/meta	It is not a meta-predictor.	"The model described does not function as a traditional meta-predictor that combines the outputs of multiple independent machine-learning algorithms. Instead, it employs a hierarchical neural network architecture designed to predict the probabilities of amino acid types for a target residue.

The architecture consists of two main components: the residue probability network and the weight network. The residue probability network considers the target residue and its neighboring residues, using shared parameters to process different target-neighbor residue pairs. This setup is analogous to the application of convolution layers in image recognition, where the same network is applied to different regions of the input image.

To address the issue of equally weighting the outputs of each target-neighbor residue pair, a weight network is introduced. This network takes the same input as the residue probability network but outputs a single weight for each pair. The outputs of the residue probability network are then multiplied by these weights and concatenated. Several fully-connected layers are constructed on top of the weighted residue probabilities, leading to a 20-dimensional softmax layer that outputs the probabilities of the 20 possible amino acid types for the target residue.

The training data for this model is derived from high-resolution protein structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with specific filtering conditions applied to ensure data quality and independence. Three datasets are prepared based on sequence identity cutoffs of 30%, 50%, and 90%, referred to as SI30, SI50, and SI90, respectively. These datasets are used to remove homologous proteins and ensure that the training data is independent.

In summary, while the model utilizes a sophisticated neural network architecture, it does not rely on the outputs of other machine-learning algorithms as input. The training data is carefully curated to ensure independence and quality, supporting the model's ability to make accurate predictions about amino acid types in protein structures."

PMC5910428	optimization/encoding	Data was encoded by extracting features from protein residues and their N closest neighboring residues.	"For the machine-learning algorithm, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps to ensure that the input features were suitable for neural network training. The input features for the neural networks were derived from both the central residues and their neighboring residues.

For the central residues, the features included the cosine and sine values of backbone dihedrals (ϕ, ψ, and ω), the total solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of backbone atoms (Cα, N, C, and O), and the secondary structure type (helix, sheet, or loop). These features were chosen to capture the conformational and structural properties of the central residues.

For the neighbor residues, the features included the cosine and sine values of backbone dihedrals (ϕ, ψ, and ω), the total SASA of backbone atoms, the Cα-Cα distance to the central residue, unit vectors defining the relative positions and orientations of the neighbor residues with respect to the central residue, the secondary structure type, and the number of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds between the central residue and the neighbor residue. These features were designed to provide a comprehensive representation of the local environment around the central residue.

The cosine and sine values of the dihedrals were used because dihedral angles, which range from -180 to 180 degrees, are not continuous at the boundaries. This encoding helps the neural network to better capture the periodic nature of dihedral angles.

The SASA values were calculated using the Naccess program on the whole protein structure, with sidechain atoms removed. This approach was taken because during protein design, the identity of a residue and thus its sidechain atoms are unknown.

Secondary structure was assigned using the Stride program. All other features were calculated with an in-house program.

To prepare the data for training, structures that satisfied specific conditions were retrieved, including sequence identity cutoffs of 30%, 50%, and 90%. Membrane proteins and structures containing D-amino acids were removed. The resulting datasets consisted of structures with varying sequence identities. For each structure, non-protein residues such as water, ions, and ligands were removed, and structural clusters were extracted based on the Cα-Cα distance to the central residue. Clusters with incomplete or low-occupancy atoms were discarded. Each cluster was then translated and oriented so that the Cα, N, and C atoms of the target residue were positioned at specific coordinates, facilitating consistent input for the neural network.

The training samples were weighted to account for the different abundances of each residue type in the training set. This weighting scheme ensured that the neural network learned more from underrepresented residue types, thereby improving the overall prediction accuracy. The output of the neural network was the probability of the 20 amino acids for the central residue of a cluster."	B_Better		2026-02-09T23:58:52.354350

2. Loss function: Categorical cross entropy.
3. Optimization: SGD with Nesterov momentum (0.9) and learning rate of 0.01.
4. Batch size: 40,000.
5. Sample weighting: Adjusted based on residue type abundance
6. Epochs: 1000"	"The neural network model utilized in this study incorporates several input parameters derived from both the target residue and its neighboring residues. These parameters include basic geometric and structural properties such as the Cα-Cα distance, cosine and sine values of backbone dihedrals (ϕ, ψ, and ω), relative location of the neighbor residue to the target residue, secondary structure types, number of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds, and solvent accessible surface area of backbone atoms.

The selection of these parameters was guided by their relevance to the structural and functional properties of proteins. For instance, the Cα-Cα distance and the unit vectors defining the position and orientation of neighbor residues help capture the spatial arrangement, which is crucial for understanding residue interactions. The cosine and sine values of dihedrals were used to handle the discontinuity in the range of dihedral angles. The solvent accessible surface area and secondary structure types provide insights into the residue's exposure to the solvent and its structural context within the protein.

The number of layers and nodes in each fully-connected layer were determined through training and testing on the smallest dataset, SI30N10. This iterative process ensured that the model's architecture was optimized for performance. The training was conducted for 1000 epochs to ensure convergence, using categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and stochastic gradient descent for optimization. The learning rate was set to 0.01, with a Nesterov momentum of 0.9 and a batch size of 40,000. Additionally, training samples were weighted to account for the different abundances of each residue type, ensuring that underrepresented residue types were given more attention during training.

The model's architecture includes a residue probability network and a weight network. The residue probability network considers the target residue and its 10–30 neighbor residues, applying the same parameters repeatedly. The weight network assigns a single weight to each target-neighbor residue pair, which is then used to adjust the output of the residue probability network. Several fully-connected layers are constructed on top of the weighted residue probabilities, leading to a 20-dimensional softmax layer that outputs the probabilities of the 20 residue types for the target residue.

Not sure about the exact number of parameters used in the model, as this detail was not explicitly mentioned. However, the model's design and training process were carefully optimized to ensure robust performance in predicting residue types."

4. Cα-Cα distance to the central residue.
5. Unit vectors from the central residue to the neighbor residues
6. Number of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds."	"The input features for the neural networks used in this study are derived from both the central (target) residues and their neighboring residues. For the central residues, the features include the cosine and sine values of backbone dihedrals (ϕ, ψ, and ω), the total solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of backbone atoms (Cα, N, C, and O), and the secondary structure type (helix, sheet, or loop).

For the neighboring residues, the features include the cosine and sine values of backbone dihedrals (ϕ, ψ, and ω), the total SASA of backbone atoms, the Cα-Cα distance to the central residue, unit vectors defining the relative positions and orientations of the residues, the secondary structure type, and the number of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds between the central and neighboring residues.

The specific features used were selected based on their relevance to the structural and geometric properties of the residues, ensuring that the neural network could effectively learn from the data. Feature selection was performed to include only the most informative features, and this process was conducted using the training set to avoid data leakage and ensure the robustness of the model.

The total number of features (f) used as input varies depending on the number of neighboring residues considered (N = 10, 15, 20, 25, 30). However, the exact count of features can be determined by summing the individual features for the central and neighboring residues. For example, for each central residue, there are 8 features (3 dihedrals × 2 + 1 SASA + 3 secondary structure types + 1 for the residue type). For each neighboring residue, there are additional features including dihedrals, SASA, distances, unit vectors, secondary structure, and hydrogen bonds. The precise count of features would depend on the specific configuration of the network and the number of neighboring residues included."	Tie_High		2026-02-09T23:59:54.908943
PMC5910428	optimization/fitting	No	"The neural network architecture employed in this study is designed to handle a substantial number of parameters relative to the training data points. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, several strategies were implemented. Firstly, the training samples were weighted to account for the varying abundance of each residue type, ensuring that the network learns more from underrepresented residue types. This weighting scheme helps in balancing the training process and prevents the model from becoming biased towards more frequent residues.

Additionally, the network was trained using stochastic gradient descent with a Nesterov momentum of 0.9 and a learning rate of 0.01. This optimization method, combined with a large batch size of 40,000, helps in stabilizing the training process and reducing the likelihood of overfitting. The use of categorical cross-entropy as the loss function further ensures that the model focuses on correctly classifying the residue types.

To rule out underfitting, the network was trained for 1000 epochs, which is sufficient to ensure convergence. The architecture includes multiple fully-connected layers, allowing the model to capture complex patterns in the data. The input features, which include geometric and structural properties of the residues, provide a rich set of information for the network to learn from. The use of cosine and sine values for backbone dihedrals ensures that the network can handle the periodic nature of these angles effectively.

The performance of the network was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation on different datasets with varying sequence identity cutoffs and numbers of neighbor residues. This rigorous evaluation process helps in assessing the generalization capability of the model and ensures that it performs well on unseen data. The results show that the network achieves high accuracy, indicating that it has neither overfitted nor underfitted the training data."	B_Better		2026-02-10T00:00:09.315669
PMC5910428	optimization/regularization	No	"In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting during the training of our neural network. One key method involved weighting the training samples to account for the varying abundance of each residue type. This was achieved using the formula \( W_i = \frac{N_{max}}{N_i} \), where \( N_{max} \) is the maximal number of samples of all 20 residue types, and \( N_i \) is the number of samples of residue type \( i \). This weighting scheme ensured that the neural network focused more on underrepresented residue types, thereby enhancing its ability to generalize across different residue types.

Additionally, we utilized five-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of our model. The dataset was randomly split into five sets, and the model was trained and validated on different combinations of these sets. This approach helped in evaluating the model's performance more robustly and in reducing the risk of overfitting to a specific subset of the data.

Furthermore, the neural network was trained for 1000 epochs to ensure convergence, which is a standard practice to allow the model to learn the underlying patterns in the data without overfitting to the training set. The use of stochastic gradient descent with a Nesterov momentum of 0.9 and a batch size of 40,000 also contributed to stabilizing the training process and preventing overfitting."

PMC5910428	model/interpretability	No mention on interpretability was made. The model appears to be a black box.	"The model developed in this study is not entirely a black box, as it incorporates several interpretable components and design choices that provide insights into its functioning. The neural network architecture consists of a residue probability network and a weight network, both of which process features derived from the geometric and structural properties of residues. These features include basic properties such as Cα-Cα distance, backbone dihedrals, secondary structures, and solvent accessible surface area, which are intuitive and directly related to the physical characteristics of proteins.

The residue probability network considers the target residue and its neighboring residues, with the number of neighbors (N) ranging from 10 to 30. This setup is analogous to convolution layers in image recognition, where the same network is applied to different regions of the input. The weight network assigns different importance to each neighbor residue, addressing the issue of equal weighting in the residue probability network. This design choice reflects the understanding that some neighbor residues have a more significant impact on the target residue than others.

The final output of the model is a 20-dimensional softmax layer, which can be interpreted as the probabilities of the 20 different residue types for the target residue. This output provides a clear and interpretable measure of the model's predictions. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as recall and precision for each amino acid, which offer further insights into its behavior and limitations.

The amino-acid specific accuracy analysis reveals that the model performs well on residues with distinct structural properties, such as Pro and Gly. This indicates that the model can learn and exploit these structural features effectively. However, the model struggles with less abundant amino acids and hydrophobic residues, highlighting areas where improvements can be made.

In summary, while the model does involve complex neural network architectures, it is designed with interpretable components and features that provide insights into its predictions.

A neural network was trained on a large dataset of protein structures, and its performance was assessed through various metrics.

One key evaluation involved comparing the network's predictions with those of a previous method called SPIN. This comparison was conducted on a set of 50 proteins, ensuring that the training set for our network did not include these proteins to maintain fairness. The results showed that our network achieved approximately 3% higher sequence identity than SPIN, indicating improved accuracy.

Additionally, the network's performance was tested on a de novo designed protein, Top7, which was not included in the training set. The top predictions from our network demonstrated higher sequence identities compared to SPIN, further validating the network's effectiveness.

The evaluation also included a comparison with the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) from PSI-BLAST. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the predicted matrices and those from PSI-BLAST was calculated, showing very similar RMSE values for both our network and SPIN. This suggests that our network, trained solely on protein sequences, can achieve comparable performance to methods that incorporate PSSMs.

Furthermore, the network's accuracy was assessed using top-K predictions, where K ranges from 1 to 10. The results indicated that the native amino acid is concentrated in the top predictions, with top-5 and top-10 accuracies being 76.3% and 91.7%, respectively. This high concentration of the native amino acid in the top predictions is crucial for identifying the correct amino acid and improving the overall accuracy of the design.

In summary, the evaluation methods included comparisons with existing techniques, testing on independent datasets, and assessing the network's ability to predict accurate sequence identities. These evaluations collectively demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the deep learning neural network approach for computational protein design."

Top-K accuracy: if the native amino acid is within the top-K predictions (K amino acids that have the highest probabilities), the prediction is considered correct."	"In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our neural network in computational protein design. The primary metric reported is the average sequence identity, which measures the percentage of amino acids in the predicted sequence that match the native sequence. This metric was calculated for the top 1 to 10 predictions, providing a comprehensive view of the network's performance.

Additionally, we compared our network's performance with that of SPIN, another method developed by Zhou and coworkers. This comparison included the average sequence identity on a test set of 50 proteins, where our network demonstrated approximately 3% higher identity than SPIN.

We also evaluated the recall and precision for each amino acid. Recall represents the percentage of native residues correctly predicted, while precision indicates the percentage of predictions that are accurate. Notably, amino acids like Pro and Gly showed higher recall and precision due to their distinct structural properties.

To further characterize the amino-acid specific accuracy, we calculated the probability of each native amino acid being predicted as one of the 20 possible amino acids. This information was visualized in a 2D heat map, where the diagonal grids showed higher probabilities, as expected. Interestingly, certain groups of amino acids, such as RK, DN, VI, and FYW, exhibited similar prediction patterns.

Moreover, we assessed the root mean square error (RMSE) of the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) predictions compared to those generated by PSI-BLAST. Our network and SPIN showed very similar RMSE values, indicating comparable performance in predicting sequence profiles.

These metrics collectively provide a robust evaluation of our neural network's performance, aligning with standard practices in the literature for assessing computational protein design methods. The use of sequence identity, recall, precision, and RMSE ensures a comprehensive and representative assessment of the network's accuracy and reliability."

SPIN was trained on a dataset of 1532 non-redundant proteins and achieved a sequence identity of 30.3% on a test set of 500 proteins.

Additionally, we evaluated our method on a de novo designed protein, Top7 (PDB ID 1QYS), which was not included in our training set. The top 1 prediction from SPIN showed an identity of 0.250, while our network's top 1 predictions from different datasets (SI30N15, SI50N15, and SI90N15) had identities of 0.283, 0.304, and 0.402, respectively. This comparison highlights the improved accuracy of our network, particularly when trained on larger datasets.

We also compared our predictions with the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) from PSI-BLAST. The root mean square error (RMSE) values for our network and SPIN were very similar (0.139 for our network and 0.141 for SPIN), indicating that both methods perform comparably in this regard. However, it is important to note that SPIN was trained on PSSMs from PSI-BLAST for predicting sequence profiles, whereas our network was trained on protein sequences only.

In summary, our neural network shows superior performance compared to SPIN, especially when trained on larger datasets. The comparison with simpler baselines, such as PSSM from PSI-BLAST, further validates the effectiveness of our approach in computational protein design."

"The evaluation of our neural network's performance includes confidence intervals for the accuracy metrics. These intervals are represented as standard deviations in the tables presenting the results. For instance, in Table 1, the accuracy values are accompanied by standard deviations in parentheses, indicating the variability and reliability of the measurements.

Statistical significance is considered in our comparisons. For example, when comparing our network's performance with SPIN, we re-trained our network on a dataset excluding the 50 proteins used for comparison to ensure a fair evaluation. The results show that our network achieves approximately 3% higher sequence identity than SPIN, suggesting a statistically significant improvement.

Additionally, the five-fold cross-validation method used in our study helps to ensure that the results are robust and not dependent on a particular split of the data. This approach provides a more reliable estimate of the network's performance and its generalizability to new, unseen data.

In summary, the performance metrics include confidence intervals, and the results demonstrate statistical significance, supporting the claim that our method is superior to others and baselines in the context of computational protein design."	Tie_High		2026-02-10T00:05:28.715552

Each Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) was trained on a randomly chosen subset of 80% of the sequences in the multiple sequence alignment (MSA), while the remaining 20% constituted the test set. This split was designed to validate the predictive power of the RBM and assess its performance on unseen data.

The independence of the training and test sets was crucial for evaluating the model's ability to generalize. To enforce this independence, we ensured that the sequences in the test set were not used during the training phase. This approach helped in preventing data leakage and overfitting, where the model might memorize the training data rather than learning general patterns.

Regarding the distribution of our datasets, they were carefully curated to represent a diverse range of protein families, including the Kunitz domain, WW domain, Hsp70, and lattice proteins. These datasets were chosen to benchmark our approach on both real and in silico data, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the RBM's capabilities.

The datasets used in our study were split in a manner similar to many previously published machine learning datasets, where a significant portion of the data is reserved for training, and a smaller portion is used for testing. This split ensures that the model's performance can be reliably assessed on data it has not seen during training.

PMC6436896	optimization/algorithm	Restricted Boltzmann Machines	"The machine-learning algorithm class used is Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). RBMs are a well-established concept in machine learning, known for their ability to learn complex data distributions through statistical features. They are unsupervised and generative, meaning they can generate new data and do not require annotated sequence data for training.

The specific RBM algorithm used in this work is not entirely new, as RBMs have been previously developed and applied in various fields. However, the method developed here represents an advancement in training RBMs efficiently from protein sequence data. This includes improvements in handling intensive sampling requirements and the introduction of dynamic reparametrization techniques, which help stabilize learning and prevent numerical instability.

The focus of this publication is on the application of RBMs to computational biology, particularly in the context of protein sequence analysis. The advancements made in training RBMs are tailored to address the specific challenges and requirements of this domain. Therefore, publishing in a computational biology journal is appropriate, as it highlights the practical applications and biological insights gained from using RBMs in this context. The improvements in the RBM training algorithm are presented as part of the methodological framework used to achieve these biological insights, rather than as a standalone contribution to the field of machine learning."

The model parameters are initialized with specific values, and the learning rate decays exponentially over time. The training algorithm also includes dynamic reparametrization for certain potentials to ensure numerical stability and efficient learning. The gauge choice is enforced throughout the training to maintain invariance in the conditional probability.

PMC6436896	optimization/encoding	aligned sequences	"In our study, we utilized Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to analyze protein sequence data. The data encoding process involved representing protein sequences as vectors on the visible layer of the RBM. Each position in a protein sequence, corresponding to an amino acid, was encoded using one of 21 possible values, representing the 20 standard amino acids plus an additional value for alignment gaps. This encoding allowed the RBM to handle sequences of varying lengths and to account for the presence of gaps in multiple sequence alignments.

The hidden layer of the RBM consisted of units that took real values, enabling the model to capture complex statistical features of the sequence data. The joint probability distribution of the visible and hidden layers was defined using a weight matrix that coupled these layers, along with local potentials that introduced biases on the visible and hidden units.

To train the RBM efficiently, we developed a method that involved applying the approach to sequence alignments of 20 different protein families. The sequences were pre-processed by aligning them to ensure that corresponding positions in different sequences were comparable. This alignment step was crucial for identifying conserved patterns and coevolutionary signals across the protein family.

The RBM was trained on a subset of the sequences, with the remaining sequences reserved for validation. This cross-validation approach allowed us to assess the model's predictive power and to tune hyperparameters such as the number of hidden units and the regularization strength. The regularization strength was particularly important for controlling the sparsity of the weight matrix, which in turn affected the model's ability to generalize to new sequences and to capture biologically meaningful features.

Overall, the data encoding and preprocessing steps were designed to enable the RBM to learn complex distributions from protein sequence data, with a focus on capturing structural, functional, and phylogenetic features that are relevant to the protein family under study."

PMC6436896	optimization/parameters	not given explicitly, a different number of hidden units (1-400) were tested	The model parameters, including the class of potentials, the number of hidden units (M), and regularization penalties, were selected based on the log-probability of a test set of natural sequences not used for training. This approach ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data. The dReLU potentials, introduced in this work, consistently outperformed other potentials for generative purposes. Increasing the number of hidden units (M) improves the likelihood up to a certain point, after which overfitting begins to occur. Adding sparsifying regularization not only prevents overfitting but also facilitates the biological interpretation of weights. This regularization is an effective way to enhance the correspondence between the representation and phenotypic spaces. It allows the model to operate at a point where most features can be activated across many regions of the sequence space, enabling the generation of a variety of new sequences with high probabilities. The specific values of these parameters were chosen to balance model complexity and generalization performance, ensuring that the model captures relevant features without overfitting to the training data.

PMC6436896	optimization/fitting	regularisation and model selection used	"The fitting method employed in this work involves training Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of proteins. The number of parameters in the RBM, such as the weights and potentials, can indeed be much larger than the number of training sequences, especially when the number of hidden units is increased. To address the risk of overfitting, several strategies were implemented.

Regularization was used to prevent overfitting. Specifically, an L1 regularization term was introduced to promote sparsity in the weights. This regularization term encourages many of the weights to be exactly zero, effectively reducing the effective number of parameters and preventing the model from memorizing the training data. The impact of the regularization strength was carefully evaluated, and it was found that mild regularization allowed the RBM to avoid overfitting and maximize the log-probability of the test set. Stronger regularization made the weights much sparser with a minimal decrease in the test set log-probability, indicating that the model was not overfitting.

Cross-validation was also employed to assess the model's performance. Each RBM was trained on a randomly chosen subset of 80% of the sequences in the MSA, while the remaining 20% were used as a test set. The average log-probability of the test set was computed to evaluate the model's predictive power for various values of the number of hidden units, regularization strength, and different hidden-unit potentials. This process ensured that the model generalized well to unseen data and did not overfit the training set.

To rule out underfitting, the number of hidden units was increased systematically. As expected, increasing the number of hidden units allowed the RBM to capture more features in the data distribution, improving performance up to a point. However, beyond a certain number of hidden units, overfitting started to occur, as indicated by the large difference between the log-probabilities of the training and test sets. Therefore, the optimal number of hidden units was determined by balancing the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting.

In summary, overfitting was ruled out through the use of regularization and cross-validation, while underfitting was addressed by systematically increasing the number of hidden units and evaluating the model's performance on a held-out test set."	B_Better		2026-02-10T00:13:29.649343
PMC6436896	optimization/regularization	L2 and L2/L1	"In our study, we employed regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance the interpretability of our Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) models. Specifically, we used L2 regularization, which is a form of weight decay that penalizes large weights, encouraging the model to find a simpler solution that generalizes better to unseen data.

We explored different strengths of regularization, denoted as l2. Without regularization (l2 = 0), the model tended to overfit, capturing idiosyncratic features of the training data rather than the invariant properties of sequences across evolutionarily divergent organisms. This resulted in generated sequences that were close to the natural ones but not very diverse.

Imposing mild regularization allowed the RBM to avoid overfitting and maximize the log-probability of the test set. However, we found that stronger regularizations had a low impact on the generalization abilities of the RBM, while making the weights much sparser. This sparsity is crucial for driving the RBM into a compositional representation regime, where each hidden unit encodes a limited portion of a sequence, and the representation of a sequence is defined by the set of hidden units with strong inputs.

We also compared L2 regularization with L1 regularization. While both methods achieved sparse weights, L1 regularization tended to disconnect hidden units entirely when the penalty was too large, making it less robust and requiring more fine-tuning. In contrast, L2 regularization achieved sparse weights without disconnecting hidden units, providing a good compromise between sparsity and generative performance.

In summary, regularization played a pivotal role in our model, not only preventing overfitting but also facilitating the biological interpretation of weights and enhancing the correspondence between representation and phenotypic spaces."	B_Better		2026-02-10T00:13:50.093844

PMC6436896	model/interpretability	yes: weights are interrelated for various case studies	"The model we employed, known as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), offers a level of interpretability that sets it apart from many other machine learning methods. Unlike traditional black-box models, RBMs can infer statistical patterns from amino-acid sequence data that are meaningful and relatable to known properties of proteins. For instance, the patterns identified by our RBMs could be linked to common structural features such as twists and loops in proteins, as well as specific activities.

This interpretability is further enhanced by the use of sparsifying regularization, which not only prevents overfitting but also makes the weights of the RBM more interpretable. By imposing regularization, we drive the RBM into a compositional representation regime, where each hidden unit encodes a limited portion of a sequence. This allows the same hidden unit to be recruited in many parts of the sequence space, corresponding to very diverse organisms. As a result, the model can generate a large diversity of sequences through combinatorial choices of the activity states of the hidden units.

For example, in the Kunitz domain, specific hidden units were found to code for the realization of contacts, demonstrating how the model can capture and represent structural properties. Similarly, in the WW domain, certain hidden units were activated by evolutionary close sequences, illustrating the model's ability to identify specific sequence motifs with structural, functional, or evolutionary meaning.

Moreover, the sparse weights inferred by the RBM make it easier to compare them across different protein families. This allows us to identify representative weights that code for a variety of structural properties, further enhancing the model's interpretability and utility in understanding complex biological data."

PMC6436896	model/output	probability score	"The model discussed is a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), which is a type of generative model used for probabilistic modeling. It is not a classification or regression model in the traditional sense. Instead, it is designed to learn the probability distribution of sequences, specifically protein sequences in this context.

The RBM operates on a bipartite graph with two layers: a visible layer representing protein sequences and a hidden layer representing latent features or representations. The model learns to capture the dependencies between the visible and hidden units, allowing it to generate new sequences and understand the underlying structure of the data.

The output of the RBM can be interpreted in several ways. Firstly, it provides a probabilistic mapping from sequences to representations, which can be indicative of the phenotype of the corresponding protein. This mapping allows for the reverse process, where representations can be used to generate sequences with desired phenotypic properties.

Additionally, the RBM's weights and biases can be analyzed to gain insights into the important features of the sequences. For example, the weights can indicate which residues and sites are most influential in the model's representation of the sequence space. This interpretability is enhanced by the use of regularization, which promotes sparsity in the weights and makes the model's representations more biologically meaningful.

The model's performance is evaluated using the log-probability of held-out test sets, which measures how well the RBM can generalize to new, unseen sequences. The choice of potentials, number of hidden units, and regularization strength are all important factors that affect the model's ability to capture the data distribution and generate diverse, high-probability sequences.

In summary, the output of the RBM is a probabilistic model of protein sequences that can be used for generative purposes and to gain insights into the important features of the sequences.

For Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) trained on real protein sequences, where ground-truth fitness is not available, the sequence quality could not be assessed numerically. However, it was shown that the generated sequences, including those with recombined features not found in nature, are consistent with a pairwise model trained on the same data.

The quality assessment of sequences generated by RBMs trained on specific domains, such as the Kunitz and WW domains, was conducted using scatter plots. These plots compared the number of mutations to the closest natural sequence against the log-probability of a Boltzmann Machine (BM) trained on the same data. The results indicated similar likelihood values for RBM-generated sequences and natural ones, even for unseen combinations.

The role of regularization and sequence reweighting in sequence generation was also examined. Sequences drawn from unregularized models were found to be closer to the training data, resulting in a sequence distribution with significantly lower entropy. Regularized models, on the other hand, produced a higher number of distinct sequences and exhibited higher entropy. Sequence reweighting played a similar role to regularization, leading to sequences that were slightly further from the training set and a model with higher entropy.

Additionally, the method was evaluated using lattice proteins (LP), where the ground truth is known. A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) containing sequences with high probabilities of folding into a specific structure was generated. An RBM with hidden units was then learned, and its performance in terms of contact predictions was compared to state-of-the-art methods. The RBM's capability to design new sequences with desired features and high fitness was also quantitatively assessed using conditional sampling. The designed sequences were found to be diverse and have large fitnesses, comparable to those of the MSA.

In summary, the evaluation of the method involved assessing the quality and diversity of generated sequences, the impact of regularization and sequence reweighting, and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods using known ground truth data."

For sequence quality, we employ the probability of folding into the native structure (pnat) for Lattice Proteins. This metric evaluates both the fitness and diversity of generated sequences, ensuring that they are not only functional but also varied and distinct from the training data.

Additionally, we consider the entropy of the sequence distribution, which measures the diversity of generated sequences. Higher entropy indicates a more diverse set of sequences, which is essential for applications like sequence design.

We also report the participation ratio as a proxy for weight sparsity. This metric helps us understand how sparse the model's weights are, which is important for interpretability and the compositional representation of sequences.

In summary, our performance metrics include log-probability for generalization, pnat for sequence quality, entropy for diversity, and participation ratio for weight sparsity.

We assessed our Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model against several alternatives, including Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders, which have been applied to protein sequence data for fitness prediction. Our RBM model differs significantly from these alternatives in several important ways. For instance, our RBM is an extension of direct-coupling approaches and requires fewer hidden units, making it more efficient. It also has a simple architecture with two layers carrying sequences and representations, which allows for the inference of interpretable weights with biological relevance.

We also compared our model to the Hopfield-Potts framework, which was previously introduced to capture both collective and localized structural modes. Our findings indicate that the Hopfield-Potts model, due to its lack of sparsity regularization and mean-field approximation, is insufficiently accurate for sequence design. In contrast, our RBM model outperforms the Hopfield-Potts framework in terms of sequence generation and contact prediction.

Additionally, we evaluated the performance of our model against simpler baselines, such as pairwise coupling models. We found that sparse regularization and a high number of hidden units in our RBM model can reproduce the performance of these pairwise models. This demonstrates the robustness and versatility of our approach.

Overall, our comparisons with publicly available methods and simpler baselines highlight the strengths of our RBM model in capturing important functional and structural features of proteins."	B_Better		2026-02-10T00:19:04.074233
PMC6436896	evaluation/confidence	not provided	"In our evaluation, we employed several methods to ensure the confidence and statistical significance of our results. For instance, we used the Annealed Importance Sampling algorithm to estimate the partition function, which allowed us to handle the high variance in the estimator by constructing a continuous path of interpolating distributions. This approach helped us to obtain more reliable estimates of the partition function ratios, which are crucial for evaluating the model's performance.

Additionally, we utilized the Persistent Contrastive Divergence algorithm during training, which proved sufficient to learn relevant features and good generative models for small proteins and regularized Restricted Boltzmann Machines. This algorithm's efficiency and accuracy were validated through our training sessions, ensuring that the model parameters evolved slowly and the samples remained at equilibrium.

We also conducted extensive testing on large protein sizes, successfully scaling our algorithm to proteins with up to approximately 700 amino acids. This testing was performed on an Intel Xeon Phi processor with 228 cores, taking around 1-2 days, which demonstrates the computational feasibility and robustness of our method.

Furthermore, we assessed the quality of the sequences generated by our models. For models trained on real protein sequences, we compared the generated sequences with natural ones using a pairwise model trained on the same data. This comparison showed that the generated sequences, including those with recombined features not found in nature, were consistent with the pairwise model, indicating the reliability of our method.

In summary, our evaluation methods included rigorous statistical techniques and extensive testing, providing confidence in the performance and superiority of our approach over baselines and other methods. The results are statistically significant, and the performance metrics are supported by reliable estimates and comparisons."

This is a well-established supervised machine learning technique, known for its robustness and ability to handle data where the number of predictors exceeds the sample size. It is particularly useful for prediction and variable importance assessment.

The random forests algorithm used is not new; it has been extensively used and validated in various fields, including genetic association studies. The choice to use this algorithm in this context is driven by its suitability for the specific challenges posed by the data, such as the need to identify important metabolites for classification and its ability to manage high-dimensional data.

The decision to use a proven algorithm like random forests, rather than developing a new one, is likely due to the focus of the study on metabolomics and genetics related to multiple sclerosis, rather than on machine learning innovation. The study aims to leverage the strengths of existing methods to gain insights into the disease, and publishing in a specialized journal aligns with the study's objectives and the target audience."

This approach is well-suited for prediction and variable importance, and it is robust to the setting of tuning parameters. The random forest consisted of 5,000 trees, and 100 randomly selected metabolites were used to determine classification at each node in a tree.

The random forest algorithm was used to rank the importance of metabolites for MS classification. A scree plot of the ranked variable importance scores was utilized to identify the top-ranking metabolites. This method does not explicitly use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input but rather focuses on the intrinsic importance of metabolites within the random forest framework.

The random forest method is non-parametric and capable of analyzing data where predictors outnumber the sample size, making it suitable for the metabolomic data analyzed in this study. The out-of-bag error for classifying the samples by MS status was reported, indicating the performance of the random forest model.

The study also employed logistic regression models to assess the relationship between each important metabolite and MS status. These models included a random effect to account for any residual batch effects. The area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals were determined by non-parametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for each metabolite. Metabolites with an AUC greater than 80% were considered top metabolites.

The integration of random forests and logistic regression provides a comprehensive approach to identifying and validating metabolites associated with MS. The random forest algorithm serves as the primary method for feature selection, while logistic regression models are used to assess the predictive power of the selected metabolites. This multi-step approach ensures that the identified metabolites are both important and predictive of MS status."

Initially, 325 metabolites with less than 30% missing observations were retained for analysis. Missing values were imputed using the default setting in MetaboAnalyst, which replaces them with half of the minimum positive values detected in the data. Batch effects were adjusted using ComBat, a method designed to remove technical variability between batches. The data were then quantile normalized and Pareto scaled to ensure a consistent distribution and to reduce the influence of outliers. This preprocessing was crucial for the random forests algorithm, which consisted of 5,000 trees and used 100 randomly selected metabolites to determine classification at each node.

PMC6548586	optimization/fitting		"In our study, we employed random forests, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to identify metabolites important for multiple sclerosis (MS) classification. The number of metabolite predictors (400) indeed outnumbered the sample size (25), which could potentially lead to overfitting. To mitigate this risk, we utilized several strategies.

Firstly, random forests are inherently robust to overfitting due to their ensemble nature and the randomness introduced in the tree-building process. We further ensured robustness by setting a high number of trees (5,000) in the forest, which helps to reduce variance and overfitting. Additionally, at each node in a tree, we used a random subset of 100 metabolites to determine the best split, which helps to decorrelate the trees and further reduces overfitting.

To rule out underfitting, we assessed the model's performance using out-of-bag (OOB) error estimation, which is an internal validation method specific to random forests. The OOB error for classifying the samples by MS status was 0.32, indicating a reasonable level of model performance given the complexity of the data and the relatively small sample size. Moreover, we validated the importance of the top metabolites using logistic regression models, which showed that eight of the twelve metabolites identified by random forests were significantly associated with MS (p<0.05), with six of them having an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 80%.

In summary, while the number of parameters was larger than the number of training points, we employed strategies specific to random forests to prevent overfitting and validated our findings using additional statistical methods to ensure the robustness of our results."

PMC6548586	optimization/regularization		"In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our findings. One key method used was random forests, a supervised machine learning algorithm known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and reduce overfitting. Random forests operate by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This ensemble approach helps to mitigate overfitting by averaging the results, thereby reducing the variance of the predictions.

Additionally, we utilized ComBat to adjust for batch effects, which is crucial in metabolomics and gene expression studies to account for technical variations between different experimental runs. By applying ComBat, we ensured that our results were not biased by these technical artifacts, thereby enhancing the reliability of our findings.

In the context of logistic regression models, we included random effects to account for any residual batch effects. This approach helps to control for unobserved heterogeneity and reduces the risk of overfitting by incorporating the variability due to batch effects into the model.

Furthermore, we conducted thorough quality control (QC) procedures for our genetic data, removing samples and SNPs with excessive missing genotypes and those that deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This rigorous QC process helped to ensure the integrity of our genetic data and reduced the likelihood of spurious associations.

Overall, these methods collectively contributed to the robustness of our analyses and helped to prevent overfitting, ensuring that our findings were reliable and generalizable."	B_Better		2026-02-10T00:24:57.001929

PMC6548586	model/interpretability	Transparent. 12 metabolites were determined to be informative for MS status	"The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It utilizes random forests, a supervised machine learning algorithm known for its interpretability. Random forests provide insights into variable importance, allowing us to identify which metabolites are most significant for multiple sclerosis (MS) classification. This is evident in the ranking of metabolites, where the top metabolites were determined based on their importance scores derived from the random forest analysis. For instance, pyroglutamate, laurate, and phosphatidylcholine PC ae C42:5 were among the top-ranked metabolites, indicating their strong association with MS status.

Additionally, the use of logistic regression models further enhances the interpretability of the results. These models assess the relationship between each important metabolite and MS status, providing p-values and area under the curve (AUC) values. Metabolites with an AUC greater than 80% were considered top metabolites, offering clear evidence of their predictive power. For example, pyroglutamate had an AUC of 0.85, and laurate had an AUC of 0.86, both indicating strong predictive performance.

The study also conducted pathway enrichment analyses, which linked the top metabolites to specific biological processes. This approach not only identifies important metabolites but also provides context on how these metabolites might be involved in MS pathology. For instance, pyroglutamate was associated with glutathione metabolism and iron homeostasis signaling, while acylcarnitine C14:1 was linked to antigen presentation. These associations help in understanding the underlying biological mechanisms.

In summary, the model's transparency is demonstrated through the use of random forests for variable importance, logistic regression for statistical significance, and pathway enrichment analyses for biological context.

The study included three groups: schizophrenia (SCZ) patients, first-degree relatives (FDRs) of SCZ patients, and healthy controls (HCs). Specifically, the dataset comprised 60 SCZ patients, 43 unaffected FDRs, and 50 HCs. An independent dataset of 40 patients and 40 controls was also used as a validation cohort.

The participants were recruited and scanned at Peking University Third Hospital using a Siemens Magnetom Trio 3.0 Tesla imaging system. The rsfMRI scans were obtained using a gradient-recalled echo-planar imaging sequence, with each scan consisting of 240 volumes of 33 axial slices. The data acquisition process ensured that participants were instructed to close their eyes, relax, and remain awake during the scans.

The preprocessing steps involved calculating frame-wise displacement to measure head movements, and excluding participants with large head movements. This resulted in a final sample of 40 controls, 34 FDRs, and 42 SCZ patients. The dataset was further analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) to extract subject-specific functional networks (FNs) from the rsfMRI data.

PMC6679781	optimization/algorithm	SVM	"The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is Support Vector Machines (SVM). This is a well-established class of algorithms in the field of machine learning, known for its effectiveness in classification tasks.

The specific SVM algorithm employed here is not new; it has been previously used and validated in similar contexts. The choice of SVM is justified by its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data, which is crucial for analyzing functional networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data.

The reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this study is on its application in neuroscience, specifically in identifying unaffected first-degree relatives with functional network patterns and cognitive impairment similar to those of schizophrenia patients. The innovation lies in the application of the SVM algorithm to this particular problem in neuroscience, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. The study aims to demonstrate the practical utility of SVM in a clinical context, contributing to the field of biomedical research rather than to the development of new machine-learning techniques."

PMC6679781	optimization/meta	No	"The model employs a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation approach to build multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Each SVM classifier generates a classification score, which is the median value of the classification scores from its nested LOO classifiers. These scores indicate whether the subject is more likely to have schizophrenia (SCZ) or be normal.

The process involves using informative functional networks (FNs) identified from the data. These FNs are selected based on their high frequency of occurrence (frequency >0.8) across subjects. The LOO cross-validation model yields 62 SVM classifiers, one for each subject in the training set. Each classifier is trained on the data of all other subjects, ensuring that the training data is independent for each subject's classifier.

The classification performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and the area under the ROC (AUC). Nonparametric permutation tests are used to estimate the statistical significance of the classification performance. This approach ensures that the model's predictions are robust and reliable.

The final classification scores for each subject are used to determine the affinity of each first-degree relative (FDR) to SCZ, with a positive score indicating a SCZ pattern. This method allows for the identification of FDRs with functional network patterns and cognitive impairment similar to those of SCZ patients."

PMC6679781	optimization/encoding	Yes, e.g. voxel resolution	"The data encoding and preprocessing steps were meticulously designed to ensure the quality and reliability of the machine-learning algorithm. Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) data were collected from participants using a Siemens Magnetom Trio 3.0 Tesla imaging system. During the acquisition, participants were instructed to close their eyes, relax, and remain awake. The rsfMRI scans consisted of 240 volumes, each with a resolution of 3.4 mm × 3.4 mm × 4.0 mm.

All images were visually inspected by neuroradiologists to check for artifacts, structural abnormalities, and pathologies. Frame-wise displacement (FD) was calculated to measure volume-to-volume changes in head position, and participants with large head movements (mean FD > 0.5 mm) were excluded from the study. This resulted in a final sample comprising 40 controls, 34 first-degree relatives (FDRs), and 42 schizophrenia (SCZ) patients.

The preprocessing steps involved several key procedures. Independent component analysis (ICA) guided by group information (GIG-ICA) was used to extract subject-specific functional networks (FNs) from the rsfMRI data. The number of independent components (ICs) was automatically estimated to be 15, based on a subset of randomly selected controls and SCZ patients. A gray matter mask was applied during ICA to minimize partial volume effects of cerebrospinal fluid and spurious effects on connectivity measures, thereby increasing the sensitivity to blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes.

For the machine-learning algorithm, a pattern classification method was employed to identify informative FNs and build support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The SVM classification was based on similarity measures between subjects computed from their FNs. A forward component selection technique was used to identify the most discriminative set of FNs. Classifiers were initially built on individual FNs, and then evaluated using leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. The FN with the best classification performance was selected, and this process was repeated to include more FNs until a single classifier was built upon all available FNs.

The informative FNs were defined as those with a high frequency (frequency >0.8). Based on these FNs, 62 SVM classifiers were generated using LOO cross-validation. Each classifier produced a classification score, with positive values indicating schizophrenia and negative values indicating normalcy. The classification performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the ROC (AUC). Nonparametric permutation tests were used to estimate the statistical significance of the classification performance."	B_Better		2026-02-10T00:30:19.955666

The selection of parameters for the SVM classifier was optimized using a nested leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation procedure. This involved tuning the parameters and choosing an optimal combination of functional networks (FNs) with a forward component selection algorithm. The forward component selection technique was used to identify the most discriminative set of FNs by iteratively building classifiers on individual FNs and combinations of FNs, evaluating them with LOO cross-validation, and selecting the FNs with the best classification performance. This process was repeated until a single classifier was built upon all available FNs, ensuring that the combination of FNs with the overall best classification performance was identified.

This procedure was repeated until a classifier was built using all available FNs. The combination of FNs that yielded the best classification performance was identified for the final classification.

The feature selection and classifier construction were carried out using the training data only. To avoid bias, a nested LOO procedure was applied to optimize the parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier and to choose an optimal combination of FNs. This ensured that the feature selection process was conducted in a manner that prevented data leakage and maintained the integrity of the validation process."	B_Better		2026-02-10T00:30:47.000715
PMC6679781	optimization/fitting	No	"The fitting method employed in this study utilized a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation approach to build SVM classifiers, which inherently helps to mitigate overfitting. By training the model on all but one subject and testing on the left-out subject, this method ensures that each subject is used as a test case exactly once. This process is repeated for each subject, resulting in 62 SVM classifiers, one for each subject in the study.

To further address overfitting, a nested LOO procedure was applied. This involved optimizing the parameters of the SVM classifier by tuning them and selecting an optimal combination of functional networks (FNs) using a forward component selection algorithm. This nested approach ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on data that was not used in the parameter tuning process, providing a more robust estimate of the model's generalization capability.

The use of nonparametric permutation tests also played a crucial role in estimating the statistical significance of the classification performance. By performing 10,000 random permutation tests with subject class labels randomly permuted, the null distribution of the classification rate was estimated. This method helps to rule out the possibility of overfitting by comparing the observed classification performance against a distribution of performances that would be expected by chance.

Additionally, the study included a certainty measure to evaluate the classification reliability for each individual subject. This measure, calculated as np/(n − 0.5), where np is the number of positive classification scores and n is the total number of LOO classifiers, ensures that subjects with lower classification certainty (<0.9) are excluded from post hoc analyses. This step helps to rule out underfitting by ensuring that only reliable classifications are considered.

The final sample comprised 27 controls, 33 first-degree relatives (FDRs), and 28 schizophrenia patients (SCZs) in the post hoc analysis, indicating a balanced and reliable dataset for evaluating the classification performance.

The transparency of the model is evident in several ways:

Firstly, the model uses a forward component selection technique to identify the most discriminative set of FNs. This process involves building classifiers on individual FNs, evaluating them with leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation, and selecting the FN with the best classification performance. This iterative process continues until the combination of FNs with the overall best classification performance is identified. This method ensures that the selection of FNs is data-driven and transparent, as each step can be traced and understood.

Secondly, the model generates classification scores that are median values of classification scores from nested LOO classifiers. These scores indicate the likelihood of a subject having SCZ (positive score) or being normal (negative score). This approach provides a clear and interpretable measure of each subject's classification.

Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated using multiple metrics, including classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the ROC (AUC). These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance and reliability.

Furthermore, the model's results are validated using an independent dataset, ensuring that the findings are robust and generalizable. The classification scores are also used to divide first-degree relatives (FDRs) into SCZ-specific and healthy control (HC)-specific subgroups, providing further insights into the model's interpretability.

In summary, the model's transparency is demonstrated through its use of clear statistical methods, interpretable classification scores, comprehensive performance metrics, and validation with an independent dataset.

These metrics provide a clear indication of the model's ability to correctly identify SCZs and HCs, as well as its performance in minimizing false positives and false negatives.

In addition to these standard metrics, we calculated the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC (AUC). The ROC curve visually represents the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity at various threshold settings, while the AUC provides a single scalar value that summarizes the overall performance of the classifier. An AUC of 0.914 indicates excellent discriminative ability, suggesting that our model can effectively differentiate between SCZs and HCs.

To ensure the robustness and statistical significance of our classification results, we conducted nonparametric permutation tests. These tests involved performing 10,000 random permutation tests with subject class labels randomly permuted, allowing us to estimate the null distribution of the classification rate. The results of these tests confirmed that our classification performance was statistically significant (p < .0001), providing strong evidence that the identified informative functional networks (FNs) are genuinely informative for distinguishing SCZs from HCs.

Furthermore, we validated our classification results on an independent testing dataset. This validation step is crucial for assessing the generalizability of our findings. The independent dataset yielded a correct classification rate of 77.5%, with an AUC of 0.811, demonstrating that our model maintains good performance even when applied to new, unseen data.

Overall, the set of performance metrics reported in our study is representative of current standards in the literature.

The key coevolutionary features extracted from these MSAs include the covariance matrix (COV), the precision matrix (PRE), and the coupling parameters of the Potts model by pseudolikelihood maximization (PLM). These features are crucial for contact-map prediction based on coevolutionary analysis.

The dataset leverages well-established sequence databases such as UniClust, UniRef90, and Metaclust. The process involves iterative searches and alignments to ensure a comprehensive and accurate MSA. For instance, HHblits is used to search against UniClust for three iterations, followed by Jackhmmer searches against UniRef90 if sufficient sequences are not obtained.

Specifically, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with residual connections, which are a well-established class of machine-learning algorithms in the field of deep learning.

The use of residual networks is not novel in the context of machine learning, as they have been extensively studied and applied in various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, their application to the specific problem of contact-map prediction in protein structure prediction is part of our innovative approach.

The reason these algorithms were not published in a machine-learning journal is that our primary focus is on the application of these techniques to biological problems, particularly in the context of protein structure prediction. The development and optimization of these models are tailored to the unique challenges and data characteristics of contact-map prediction, which is a specialized area within computational biology.

Our implementation of these neural networks is done using the PyTorch framework, which is a widely-used open-source machine-learning library. The models are trained using the Adam optimizer, a popular stochastic gradient descent method known for its efficiency and effectiveness in training deep neural networks. The initial learning rate is set to 1e-3, and the training process runs for 50 epochs. This setup ensures that the models converge to an optimal solution while managing computational resources efficiently."	B_Better		2026-02-10T09:49:44.182929
PMC6851483	optimization/meta	Algorithm 1: No.  Algorithm 2: Yes. The network is actually composed of two subnetworks (called Stage 1 and Stage 2 in the paper), the first giving the inputs to the second. 	"In our study, we developed two meta-predictors, TripletRes and ResTriplet, which integrate information from multiple components to enhance contact prediction accuracy, particularly for hard free-modeling (FM) targets. These meta-predictors use raw coevolutionary features, including the covariance matrix, the precision matrix, and the parameter matrix of a pseudolikelihood maximized Potts model. These features are derived from direct coupling analysis (DCA) methods, which aim to reduce transitional noise in contact predictions.

TripletRes and ResTriplet employ different strategies to ensemble these features. TripletRes uses end-to-end training, where multiple models are trained on different subsets of the data, and their outputs are averaged to produce the final prediction. This approach helps to mitigate overfitting and improves the robustness of the model, especially for FM targets with limited sequence homologs.

ResTriplet, on the other hand, uses a stacking strategy. In the first stage, it generates predicted contact-maps using 10-fold cross-validation for each coevolutionary feature type. These predicted contact-maps serve as features for the second stage, where a final model is trained without cross-validation due to time constraints. This stacking approach allows ResTriplet to leverage the strengths of different coevolutionary features and improve overall prediction accuracy.

Both meta-predictors were trained using the Adam optimizer with a default initial learning rate of 1e-3 for 50 epochs. The training data for TripletRes and ResTriplet is independent, as they share the same training set but use different data splitting strategies for model training. This independence ensures that the performance of the meta-predictors is not biased by overlapping training data.

In summary, TripletRes and ResTriplet are meta-predictors that combine information from multiple coevolutionary features using end-to-end training and stacking strategies, respectively. They demonstrate improved performance, particularly for FM targets, by leveraging the complementary information from different components and ensuring independent training data."

PMC6851483	optimization/encoding	For each sequence a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed.	"In our study, we utilized three coevolutionary features derived from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to encode the data for our machine-learning algorithms. The first feature is the covariance matrix, which captures the marginal correlations between residue pairs at different positions in the protein sequence. This matrix is computed based on the observed relative frequencies of residue pairs and individual residues.

The second feature is the precision matrix, obtained by minimizing an objective function that includes the trace of the product of the covariance and precision matrices, the log determinant of the precision matrix, and an L2 regularization term. This matrix provides direct couplings between pairs of sites conditional on other positions, offering better performance in contact-map prediction compared to the covariance matrix.

The third feature involves the coupling parameters of the Potts model, approximated through pseudolikelihood maximization. These parameters are efficiently calculated using CCMpred. All three features are represented as 21∙L by 21∙L matrices, where L is the sequence length and 21 accounts for the 20 standard amino acid types plus a gap type. Each position pair is represented by a 21 by 21 sub-matrix of coupling parameters, which are then reshaped into three input features of size L by L by 441 for each sequence.

For the neural network architectures, we employed deep residual neural networks (ResNet) and did not apply any pre-normalization to the input features. Instead, an instance normalization layer was added after each convolutional layer, except the last one. This approach helps in stabilizing the training process and improving the performance of the models. The training set was divided into subsets for cross-validation, and the output was averaged across multiple models to enhance the robustness of the predictions. Dynamic batch sizes were used during training to accommodate sequences of different lengths, ensuring efficient use of GPU resources. The choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, was a balance between memory usage and performance, aiming to fit the models into GPU memory for efficient training."

PMC6851483	optimization/parameters	Not stated	"The models discussed in this publication utilize deep residual neural networks (ResNet) for contact-map prediction. The specific architectures employed are TripletRes and ResTriplet.

In TripletRes, each of the three coevolutionary features (COV, PRE, and PLM) is processed through a set of 24 residual blocks. Each residual block consists of two convolutional layers, with instance normalization and dropout layers added to enhance training speed and prevent overfitting. The dropout rate is set to 0.2. The kernel size of the convolutional layers is 3 × 3 with padding to maintain spatial information. Additionally, a 1 × 1 convolutional layer is used to transform each coevolutionary input feature into 64 channels. The final contact-map prediction is obtained through a sigmoid activation function over the output of a convolutional layer with one output channel.

ResTriplet follows a two-stage ensemble approach. In Stage I, three individual base models are trained separately using the three coevolutionary features. Each base model consists of 22 residual blocks. In Stage II, a shallow neural network combines the predictions from Stage I, along with predicted secondary structures, using a collection of 5 dilated convolutional layers with a dilation value of 2 and 16 channels. The final output is obtained through a dilated convolutional layer with a dilation value of 2 and one output channel, followed by a sigmoid activation function.

The choice of hyperparameters, including the number of layers, is a compromise between memory usage and performance. Deeper models can theoretically yield better performance, but the number of layers is limited by GPU memory constraints. The models are trained using the Adam optimizer with a default initial learning rate of 1e-3 for 50 epochs. A dynamic batch size strategy is employed based on the sequence length to optimize GPU resource usage."	B_Better		2026-02-10T09:51:09.590823
PMC6851483	optimization/features	For each sequence three matrix features are generated: Covariance matrix, Precision Matrix, coupling parameters of the Potts model.	"Three coevolutionary features are used as input for the contact-map prediction pipeline. These features are derived from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and include the covariance matrix, the precision matrix, and the coupling parameters of the Potts model. The covariance matrix captures the marginal correlations between residue pairs, while the precision matrix provides direct couplings between pairs of sites conditional on other positions. The coupling parameters of the Potts model are calculated using pseudolikelihood maximization.

Feature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense. Instead, the focus was on extracting meaningful coevolutionary features from the MSAs. The choice of these three features was based on their demonstrated effectiveness in previous studies and their ability to capture different aspects of residue-residue interactions.

The data splitting strategy ensures that the training and validation sets are independent, which is crucial for avoiding overfitting and ensuring the generalizability of the models. For TripletRes, the training set was divided into 10 subsets, with each subset used as a validation set while the remaining subsets were used for training. This 10-fold cross-validation approach was also applied in Stage I of ResTriplet for each coevolutionary feature type. However, in Stage II of ResTriplet, cross-validation was not performed due to time constraints before the CASP experiment."	B_Better		2026-02-10T09:51:25.418812
PMC6851483	optimization/fitting		"In our study, we employed two deep learning models, TripletRes and ResTriplet, for contact-map prediction. Both models utilize raw coevolutionary features derived from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), specifically the covariance matrix, the precision matrix, and the coupling parameters of a pseudolikelihood maximized Potts model.

The number of parameters in our neural networks is indeed much larger than the number of training points, which is a common scenario in deep learning. To mitigate the risk of over-fitting, we implemented several strategies.

For TripletRes, we used 10-fold cross-validation during training. The training set was divided into 10 subsets, with each subset serving as the validation set in turn, while the remaining subsets were used for training. This process was repeated 10 times, and the final output was the average of all 10 models. This approach helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

In the case of ResTriplet, we also used 10-fold cross-validation in Stage I to reduce over-fitting. However, due to time constraints before the CASP experiment, cross-validation was not performed in Stage II. Instead, we relied on the diversity and depth of the MSAs generated by different alignment protocols to improve the robustness of our predictions.

To address the potential issue of under-fitting, we carefully designed our neural network architectures based on deep residual networks (ResNet). These architectures allow for the training of very deep networks, which can capture complex patterns in the data. Additionally, we used a dynamic batch size strategy during training to efficiently utilize GPU resources, which helps in better convergence of the model.

The training of our models was conducted using the Adam optimizer with a default initial learning rate of 1e-3 for 50 epochs. This optimizer is known for its efficiency and adaptability, which helps in finding the optimal parameters for the model.

In summary, we employed cross-validation, deep residual network architectures, and efficient training strategies to balance the trade-off between over-fitting and under-fitting in our contact-map prediction models."	B_Better		2026-02-10T09:51:38.940309
PMC6851483	optimization/regularization	No.	"In our study, several techniques were employed to prevent over-fitting during the training of our models. One of the key methods used was instance normalization, which was applied after each convolutional layer except the last one in both TripletRes and ResTriplet. This helped to stabilize the training process and reduce the risk of over-fitting by normalizing the features within each instance.

Additionally, dropout layers were incorporated into the neural network architecture. The dropout rate was set to 0.2, meaning that 20% of the input signals were randomly masked at each training batch. This technique helps to prevent the model from becoming too reliant on specific neurons, thereby improving generalization.

For TripletRes, a 10-fold cross-validation strategy was implemented. The training set was divided into 10 subsets, with each subset serving as the validation set while the remaining subsets were used for training. This approach ensured that the model was evaluated on different portions of the data, reducing the likelihood of over-fitting to any single subset.

In the first stage of ResTriplet, a similar 10-fold cross-validation was used to generate predicted contact-maps for each base model. This method helped to mitigate over-fitting by ensuring that the model's performance was assessed across multiple validation sets.

Furthermore, a dynamic batch size strategy was adopted during training to accommodate the varying lengths of sequences. This strategy helped to efficiently utilize GPU resources and ensured that the model could handle sequences of different lengths without over-fitting to any particular batch size.

Overall, these regularization techniques played a crucial role in enhancing the robustness and generalization capabilities of our models, thereby improving the accuracy of contact-map predictions."	B_Better		2026-02-10T09:52:48.188531

For TripletRes, training required 4 GPUs running concurrently, while ResTriplet could be handled with a single GPU. A dynamic batch size strategy was implemented to manage GPU resources effectively, with batch sizes varying based on sequence length.

The model architectures, including the number of residual blocks and convolutional layers, are also described.

PMC6851483	model/interpretability	Black box.	"The models discussed, TripletRes and ResTriplet, are primarily based on deep residual neural networks, which are known for their complexity and are generally considered black-box models. This means that the internal workings of these models are not easily interpretable, and it is challenging to directly understand how specific inputs lead to particular outputs.

However, there are some aspects of the models that provide insights into their functioning. For instance, the use of coevolutionary features derived from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) offers a degree of interpretability. These features, such as the covariance matrix, precision matrix, and coupling parameters of the Potts model, capture evolutionary relationships between residue pairs. By examining these matrices, one can gain some understanding of the residue interactions that the models are learning.

Additionally, the architecture of the models includes residual blocks, which help in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and allow for deeper networks. The use of instance normalization and dropout layers also provides some transparency by helping to regularize the model and prevent overfitting.

In the case of ResTriplet, the two-stage ensemble approach adds another layer of interpretability. In Stage I, separate base models are trained on different coevolutionary features, and their predictions are combined in Stage II. This stacking strategy allows for the examination of how different types of coevolutionary information contribute to the final contact-map prediction.

Moreover, the models incorporate predicted secondary structures as additional features, which can be visualized and interpreted. This inclusion helps in understanding how secondary structure information influences the contact-map predictions.

Overall, while the models are complex and largely black-box, the use of interpretable features and a structured ensemble approach provides some level of transparency. This allows researchers to gain insights into the factors that contribute to the models' predictions."	B_Better		2026-02-10T09:53:54.637569
PMC6851483	model/output	The model produces a prediction of the contact map for each residue pair in the sequence alignment.	"The model is a regression model designed for contact map prediction in proteins. It predicts the likelihood of contacts between residue pairs, rather than classifying them into discrete categories. The final output is obtained through a sigmoid activation function, which provides a probability score for each potential contact. This approach is crucial for understanding protein folding and structure, as it helps identify which amino acid residues are likely to be in close proximity within the three-dimensional structure of the protein.

The model employs two main architectures: TripletRes and ResTriplet. TripletRes directly ensembles three coevolutionary features using neural networks, transforming each input feature through a series of residual blocks and concatenating the outputs. The final prediction is made using a convolutional layer followed by a sigmoid activation.

ResTriplet, on the other hand, uses a two-stage ensemble strategy. In the first stage, three base models are trained separately on different coevolutionary features. These models produce predicted contact maps, which are then used as input features in the second stage. Additionally, predicted secondary structures are included as extra features. The second stage employs a shallow neural network with dilated convolutional layers to combine the predictions from the base models, ultimately producing the final contact map prediction through a sigmoid function.

Both models utilize residual blocks with instance normalization and dropout layers to enhance training efficiency and prevent overfitting. The training process involves cross-validation and dynamic batch sizes to optimize performance given the constraints of GPU resources. The final output is a contact map that indicates the probability of contacts between residue pairs, aiding in the prediction of protein structures."	B_Better		2026-02-10T09:54:05.289588
PMC6851483	model/duration	Not stated.	"The execution time for the models varied due to differences in their architectures and resource requirements. The training of TripletRes required the use of 4 GPUs running concurrently, which allowed for parallel processing and faster training times. In contrast, the training procedures of ResTriplet could be handled with just one GPU. This difference in GPU usage reflects the varying computational demands of the two models.

A dynamic batch size strategy was employed during training to optimize the use of GPU resources. Specifically, a batch size of 1 was used for sequences with a length greater than 300, a batch size of 2 for sequences between 200 and 300 in length, and a batch size of 4 for sequences with a length less than 200. This strategy helped to manage the limited GPU resources effectively, ensuring that the models could be trained efficiently without exceeding the memory capacity of the GPUs.

The choice of hyperparameters, particularly the number of layers, was a compromise between memory usage and performance. While deeper convolutional neural network (CNN) models could theoretically yield better performance, the practical constraints of GPU memory limited the number of layers that could be used. This balance was crucial for ensuring that the models could be trained efficiently within the available computational resources.

In summary, the execution time for the models was influenced by the number of GPUs used, the dynamic batch size strategy, and the trade-offs made in choosing hyperparameters to optimize performance within the constraints of available GPU memory."

PMC6851483	evaluation/method	Indipendent dataset (Dataset 2, i.e. CASP13)	"The evaluation of the methods TripletRes and ResTriplet was conducted using a comprehensive approach that included cross-validation and performance assessment on specific targets. For TripletRes, a 10-fold cross-validation strategy was employed, where the training set was divided into 10 subsets. Each subset was used as a validation set while the remaining subsets were used for training. This process was repeated 10 times, and the final output was the average of all 10 models. This method ensured that each data point was used for both training and validation, providing a robust evaluation of the model's performance.

In Stage I of ResTriplet, a similar 10-fold cross-validation approach was used to reduce the risk of overfitting. For each coevolutionary feature type, 10 models were built using the same data splitting strategy as TripletRes. The predicted contact-maps of the validation set from each model were then used as features for Stage II. However, in Stage II, cross-validation was not performed due to time constraints before the CASP experiment.

The overall performance of the methods was evaluated on the CASP13 dataset, which included 90 full-length protein targets. The assessment focused on the precision of contact predictions at different ranges: short range, medium range, and long-range. The precision was measured for the top L, L/2, and L/5 contacts, providing a detailed evaluation of the methods' accuracy. The results showed that both TripletRes and ResTriplet achieved high precision in long-range contact predictions, demonstrating their effectiveness in predicting distant interactions within proteins.

Additionally, the methods were evaluated on free-modeling (FM) targets, which lack homologs in structure and sequence databases. This evaluation highlighted the robustness of TripletRes and ResTriplet, particularly in handling challenging targets with limited sequence information. The performance on FM targets was assessed by comparing the precision of contact predictions with the number of effective sequences (Nf) in the multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The results indicated that TripletRes was less dependent on the quality of MSAs, while ResTriplet showed a higher sensitivity to the content of the MSAs. Despite this, both methods achieved reasonable contact accuracy even with a very limited number of sequence homologs, underscoring their ability to learn underlying contact patterns from sparse data."

PMC6851483	evaluation/measure	Prediction accuracy (performed by CASP13 assesors)	"In our evaluation, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our methods, TripletRes and ResTriplet, in predicting protein contacts. The primary metrics we reported include precision for short, medium, and long-range contacts. These ranges are defined based on the sequence separation between residue pairs: short-range contacts have a sequence separation of 6 to 11 residues, medium-range contacts have a separation of 12 to 23 residues, and long-range contacts have a separation of 24 or more residues. We evaluated precision at different thresholds, specifically top L, L/2, and L/5 contacts, where L is the length of the query sequence.

For long-range contacts, which are particularly challenging to predict, we observed that TripletRes and ResTriplet achieved comparable performance. TripletRes showed a slight edge in accuracy for top L and L/5 long-range contacts, but the differences were statistically insignificant. This indicates that both methods are robust and reliable for predicting long-range contacts.

We also examined the impact of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) on prediction accuracy. The quality of MSAs, measured by the number of effective sequences (Nf), is crucial for the performance of our methods. We found that deeper MSAs do not always lead to better contact prediction due to potential alignment noise. However, both TripletRes and ResTriplet demonstrated the ability to learn underlying contact patterns even from a limited number of sequence homologs, which is vital for modeling free-modeling (FM) targets that lack homologous sequences.

Additionally, we compared the performance of our ensemble methods against individual component predictors. The ensemble approaches significantly outperformed the individual components, particularly for FM targets. This highlights the importance of integrating information from multiple sources to improve prediction accuracy.

In summary, our performance metrics are representative of the current literature in protein contact prediction. We focused on precision for different contact ranges and thresholds, which are standard metrics in the field. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of TripletRes and ResTriplet in predicting protein contacts, especially for challenging FM targets."	B_Better		2026-02-10T09:56:34.933673

"In the ""Methods Comparison"" subsection, we evaluated the performance of our proposed methods, TripletRes and ResTriplet, against simpler baselines and publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we compared the results of our hybrid methods against three predictors using individual component input features on CASP13 FM targets. These components included PLM, PRE, and COV features.

The comparison revealed that the ensemble methods significantly outperformed the individual component predictors for FM targets. For instance, the mean precision of long-range top L/5 contacts for TripletRes was 64.6%, which was 10.6%, 8.6%, and 12.0% higher than the precisions achieved by predictors based on PLM, PRE, and COV, respectively. Similarly, the stacked ensemble of ResTriplet achieved a mean precision of 64.0%, which was 9.6%, 7.6%, and 10.9% higher than the mean precisions of each component.

When considering all targets, the ensemble methods only slightly outperformed the component predictors. For example, the top L/5 long-range average precision of TripletRes and ResTriplet for all targets were 75.4% and 76.2%, respectively, which were marginally higher than the 75.2%, 74.6%, and 71.0% achieved by predictors based on PLM, PRE, and COV features.

"The evaluation of our methods, TripletRes and ResTriplet, includes statistical significance tests to ensure the robustness of our claims. For instance, the improvement in contact prediction precision when using DeepMSA over HHBlits was found to be statistically significant, with p-values of 2.9e-06 and 1.1e-04 for TripletRes and ResTriplet, respectively. This indicates that the observed improvements are unlikely to be due to chance.

In terms of comparing TripletRes and ResTriplet, the differences in performance for long-range contact predictions were found to be statistically insignificant. The p-values for the differences in top L and L/5 long-range contact accuracies were 0.82 and 0.65, respectively. This suggests that while TripletRes may have a slight edge in accuracy, the difference is not statistically significant.

Additionally, the Pearson correlation coefficients between precision and the logarithm of the number of effective sequences (Nf) in the multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were calculated. These coefficients were 0.584 for TripletRes and 0.551 for ResTriplet, indicating modest correlations. This analysis helps to understand the relationship between the quality of MSAs and the performance of our methods.

Overall, the statistical analyses provide confidence in the performance metrics and the claims made about the superiority of our methods in certain contexts. However, it is important to note that statistical significance does not always translate to practical significance, and the context of the results should be considered when interpreting their importance."

Molecules that were not recognized by RDKit, a cheminformatics toolkit, were also deleted. This left us with two essential columns: 'smiles' and 'experimental value', which served as the input data for our models.

Each SMILES representation was then converted into a directed graph before training the SAMPN model using the MPN encoder, adapted from Deepchem and Chemprop. The directed graphs were primarily composed of index lists of nodes and edges. For instance, a chemical bond between nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) atoms could derive two edges (C:0 → N:1 and N:0 → C:1). The number of nodes corresponded to the number of atoms, while the number of edges was double the number of bonds, considering edges as bidirectional.

The message-passing network encoder utilized molecular graph structures, where atoms were equivalent to nodes and chemical bonds to edges. This approach allowed for the gradual merging of information from distant atoms by extending radially through bonds. The passing messages were used to encode all substructures of a molecule through an adaptive learning approach, extracting useful representations suited to the target predictions.

Node features were derived from attributes such as atom type, formal charge, valence, and aromaticity. Similarly, edge features were derived from bond order, ring status, and direction connection. The initial message passing involved generating messages from the merged node-edge features using a neural network. Subsequent message passing steps involved updating messages based on the merged node-edge features and previous message passing steps, ensuring that nodes could send messages to neighbor nodes only after receiving messages from all other neighbors.

This encoding process ensured that the model could generalize to new molecules effectively, avoiding mere memorization of the training data. The use of directed graphs and message-passing networks provided a robust framework for encoding molecular structures, enabling accurate predictions in our machine-learning models."

These hyperparameters included the activation function, steps of message passing, graph embedding size, dropout rate, and the number of layers in the fully connected network. The specific ranges and intervals for these hyperparameters were defined to ensure a comprehensive search space.

The activation function choices included Tanh, ELU, LeakyReLU, ReLU, PReLU, and SELU. The steps of message passing ranged from 2 to 6, with an interval of 1. The graph embedding size varied from 32 to 512, with an interval of 32. The dropout rate spanned from 0.0 to 0.4, with an interval of 0.05. The number of layers in the fully connected network ranged from 1 to 3, with an interval of 1.

A grid search algorithm, implemented using the Hyperopt package version 0.1.2, was employed to adjust these hyperparameters. The search space was thoroughly explored to find the most suitable combination of hyperparameters. For the lipophilicity-QSPR task, one of the best combinations of hyperparameters identified was {'activation': 'ReLU', 'depth': 4, 'dropout': 0.25, 'layers of fully connected networks': 2, 'hidden size': 384}.

This combination was then used to test the final performance of all message passing neural network models, including MPN, SAMPN, Multi-MPN, and Multi-SAMPN, using tenfold stratified cross-validation on the entire dataset. The selection of these hyperparameters was crucial in achieving robust and accurate predictions for the properties of interest."	Tie_High		2026-02-10T10:09:14.041563

Each molecule was converted into a directed graph, where atoms correspond to nodes and chemical bonds to edges. This approach allowed us to utilize the inherent structural information of the molecules without relying on manually selected features.

The number of features, in this case, is dynamic and depends on the molecular structure. Specifically, the number of nodes in the graph is equal to the number of atoms in the molecule, and the number of edges is double the number of bonds, considering edges as bidirectional.

Feature selection, in the traditional sense, was not performed. Instead, we used the entire molecular graph as input, capturing all relevant structural information. This method ensures that no important features are inadvertently excluded, providing a comprehensive representation of each molecule.

The preprocessing steps, including the conversion of SMILES to directed graphs, were applied uniformly to the entire dataset. This process ensures that the models are trained and validated on consistent and complete feature sets, maintaining the integrity of the structural information across all molecules."

PMC7035778	optimization/fitting	The used dataset is fairly small, considering that ANN is used as the model algorithm and it easily overfit on small datasets. Authors adopted a 10-fold cross validation strategy to improve generalization.	"In our study, we employed several strategies to ensure that our models were neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. Overfitting is a common concern when the number of parameters in a model is much larger than the number of training points, but we mitigated this risk through several techniques.

Firstly, we used a grid search algorithm with the Hyperopt package to optimize the hyperparameters of our models. This process involved systematically working through multiple combinations of hyperparameter values to find the best configuration. By doing so, we ensured that our models were not overly complex and that they generalized well to unseen data.

Secondly, we implemented a self-attention mechanism in our message passing neural network (SAMPN) models. This mechanism helps the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the molecular structure, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting by not relying on every single parameter equally.

Additionally, we utilized tenfold stratified cross-validation on the entire dataset. This technique involves dividing the data into ten subsets, training the model on nine subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. Cross-validation helps to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting.

To address underfitting, we ensured that our models had sufficient capacity to learn the underlying patterns in the data. This was achieved by carefully selecting the architecture of our neural networks, including the number of layers and the size of the hidden layers. We also used the Adam optimizer with an appropriate learning rate schedule, which helped the models to converge to a good solution without getting stuck in local minima.

Furthermore, we compared our models with a baseline random forest model, which is known for its robustness and high prediction accuracy in structure-property relationship research. The fact that our models outperformed the random forest model indicates that they were not underfitting the data.

In summary, through hyperparameter optimization, the use of self-attention mechanisms, cross-validation, and careful selection of model architecture, we ensured that our models were neither overfitting nor underfitting the data."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:11:31.156070
PMC7035778	optimization/regularization	Authors adopted a 10-fold cross validation strategy to improve generalization.	"In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the key methods used was dropout, which is a regularization technique that helps to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero at each update during training time. This forces the network to learn redundant representations and prevents it from becoming too reliant on any single neuron. In our best-performing models, we used a dropout rate of 0.25.

Additionally, we utilized tenfold stratified cross-validation. This technique involves splitting the dataset into ten subsets, training the model on nine of them, and validating it on the remaining one. This process is repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This approach ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data and does not simply memorize the training set.

Furthermore, we repeated all experiments three times with different random seeds. This step helps to ensure that the results are not dependent on a particular random initialization and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

By combining these techniques, we aimed to build models that are not only accurate but also robust and capable of generalizing to new molecular structures."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:12:53.936710

PMC7035778	model/interpretability	The attention mechanism of the model indicates the degree to which each atom of the molecule contributes to the property of interest, and these results are visualized. Hence, it is interpretable.	"The model we developed, the self-attention-based message-passing neural network (SAMPN), is designed to be more interpretable than traditional black-box models. Unlike many neural network models that act as black boxes, making it difficult to understand how predictions are made, SAMPN incorporates an attention mechanism that highlights the importance of different parts of a molecule in determining its properties.

This attention mechanism allows us to visualize which atoms or substructures within a molecule contribute most significantly to its lipophilicity or aqueous solubility. By assigning attention weight scores to each atom, we can identify which parts of the molecule are crucial for the property of interest. These attention weight coefficients are particularly useful for gaining insights into how specific molecular features enhance or diminish the target property.

For example, in the case of 1H-indazole, the model can indicate that the nitrogen-containing section of the molecule has strong anti-lipophilic properties. This information can guide chemists in modifying the molecule to potentially increase its lipophilicity. Similarly, for a molecule with a primary amine group, the model can show that this group contributes to the molecule's solubility due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.

The visualization of these attention scores on molecular graphs, using heat maps, makes it easy to see which parts of a molecule play a more important role in its properties. This interpretability is a significant advantage, as it allows chemists to optimize molecular properties directly from the chemical structures, providing a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the predictions."

PMC7035778	model/output	It is a regressor model.	"The model is a regression model. It is designed to predict continuous properties of molecules, specifically lipophilicity and aqueous solubility. These properties are quantified using logarithmic scales (logP for lipophilicity and logS for solubility), which are continuous values. The model uses various metrics to evaluate its performance, such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE), all of which are relevant for regression tasks. Additionally, the model's performance is compared using these metrics, indicating that it is indeed a regression model aimed at predicting numerical values rather than classifying data into discrete categories.

The model employs a self-attention-based message-passing neural network (SAMPN) and its variants, which are trained to learn the relationships between molecular structures and their properties. The use of metrics like RMSE and MAE further confirms that the model's output is a continuous value, making it a regression model."	Tie_High		2026-02-10T10:14:41.201225

PMC7035778	evaluation/method	The model was evaluated through a 10-fold cross-validation that uses 10% of the data as the test set.	"The evaluation of our models involved several key steps and metrics to ensure robust and generalizable performance. We employed multiple metrics to assess the models' predictive performance, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R²), and Pearson correlation coefficient (PC). Lower values of MAE, MSE, and RMSE indicate better predictive performance, while higher values of PC and R² signify better model fits.

Given the relatively small size of our datasets compared to typical deep learning requirements, we utilized tenfold stratified cross-validation. This process involved randomly splitting each dataset into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. We repeated all experiments three times with different random seeds to ensure that the models could generalize to new molecules rather than merely memorizing the training data.

For hyperparameter optimization, we used a grid search algorithm with the Hyperopt package. The search space included various hyperparameters such as activation functions, steps of message passing, graph embedding size, dropout rate, and layers of fully connected networks. We chose RMSE on the validation set as the metric to identify the most suitable combination of hyperparameters.

In the lipophilicity-QSPR task, one of the best combinations of hyperparameters was found to be {'activation': 'ReLU', 'depth': 4, 'dropout': 0.25, 'layers of fully connected networks': 2, 'hidden size': 384}. All message passing neural network models (MPN, SAMPN, Multi-MPN, and Multi-SAMPN) utilized these hyperparameters for final performance testing using tenfold stratified cross-validation on the entire dataset.

To compare our self-attention-based message-passing neural network (SAMPN) with traditional machine learning methods, we also implemented a random forest (RF) model. The RF model used extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFP) with a fixed length of 1024 and was implemented using the Scikit-learn package in Python. We set the number of trees to 500 to balance performance and computational efficiency.

The results demonstrated that our SAMPN model outperformed both the traditional RF model and previous deep-learning models, such as Deepchem's MPN. The inclusion of the self-attention mechanism and the use of multi-target models further improved performance, indicating that these enhancements are effective in predicting lipophilicity and solubility."

PMC7035778	evaluation/measure	"Multiple metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the model: mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE),

These metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R²), and Pearson correlation coefficient (PC). These metrics provide a thorough assessment of model performance.

Lower values of MAE, MSE, and RMSE indicate better predictive performance, as they measure the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. Conversely, higher values for PC and R² signify better model performance or better fits for the data, as they assess the correlation and the proportion of variance explained by the model, respectively.

The inclusion of multiple metrics ensures a rich benchmark for future studies, allowing for a more nuanced comparison of model performance. This approach is representative of current practices in the field, where a combination of error metrics and correlation measures is commonly used to evaluate predictive models. By reporting these metrics, we aim to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of our models' strengths and areas for improvement."	Tie_High		2026-02-10T10:16:04.238792
PMC7035778	evaluation/comparison	In each task, authors built RF, MPN, SAMPN, multiMPN and multi-SAMPN models to explore the relationship between the target property and the molecular structure. 	"In our study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of our self-attention-based message-passing neural network (SAMPN) with various methods to evaluate its performance. We compared SAMPN with traditional machine learning methods, specifically using a random forest (RF) model as a baseline. The RF model is widely recognized for its robustness, ease of use, and high prediction accuracy in structure–property relationship research. We implemented the RF model using the Scikit-learn package in Python, with extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFP) of a fixed length of 1024 as features. We set the number of trees to 500, which provided a good balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Additionally, we built a pure message-passing neural network (MPN) model to establish a baseline without the self-attention mechanism. This allowed us to isolate the impact of the self-attention component in our SAMPN model. All configurations, except for the self-attention mechanism, were kept the same between the MPN and SAMPN models.

To further evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we compared single-task and multi-target deep learning networks. We developed multi-MPN and multi-SAMPN models that used a merged molecule dataset from ‘Lipophilicity’ and ‘Water Solubility’. This comparison helped us understand the benefits of multi-target models in leveraging shared features between different properties.

We also compared our models with the MPN version from Deepchem, a popular deep learning library for cheminformatics. This comparison was performed on the same datasets and using the same stratified cross-validation protocol to ensure fairness. The results showed that our SAMPN model outperformed both the traditional RF model and the Deepchem MPN model in predicting lipophilicity and solubility.

In summary, our evaluation included comparisons with traditional machine learning baselines, simpler neural network baselines, and publicly available deep learning methods on benchmark datasets. This thorough comparison demonstrated the superior performance and interpretability of our SAMPN model."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:16:26.513784
PMC7035778	evaluation/confidence	Standard deviations are reported for each of the used metrics.	"The evaluation of our models involved multiple metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R²), and Pearson correlation coefficient (PC). These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance. Importantly, the reported values for RMSE, which was used as the primary metric for hyperparameter optimization, include confidence intervals. For instance, in the lipophilicity prediction task, the RMSE for the SAMPN model is reported as 0.579 ± 0.036, and for the Multi-SAMPN model, it is 0.571 ± 0.032. These intervals indicate the variability and reliability of the performance estimates.

To ensure the robustness of our findings, we employed tenfold stratified cross-validation. This method involves randomly splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets multiple times with different random seeds. This process helps to ensure that the models do not overfit to the training data and can generalize well to new, unseen molecules. The use of cross-validation, along with the reported confidence intervals, provides a strong basis for claiming that our models, particularly the SAMPN and Multi-SAMPN, offer superior performance compared to traditional machine learning methods and previous deep-learning models.

Statistical significance is further supported by the consistent performance improvements observed across different metrics and tasks. For example, in both lipophilicity and solubility predictions, the SAMPN and Multi-SAMPN models outperformed the MPN and Multi-MPN models, respectively. This consistency suggests that the self-attention mechanism and multi-target approach contribute significantly to the models' predictive power. Additionally, the comparison with the random forest model, a widely regarded ""gold standard"" in structure–property relationship research, further validates the superiority of our methods. The random forest model's performance was notably lower in both tasks, reinforcing the claim that our models provide a more accurate and reliable prediction of chemical properties."

Proteins longer than 700 amino acid residues were excluded from all datasets.

Additionally, three independent test datasets (SL250, Mobi9414, and DisProt228) were obtained for fair comparison against other methods. These datasets were subsets from established sets, with long proteins and homologous proteins in the training dataset removed. The DisProt228 dataset consists of newly-annotated proteins deposited in the DisProt database v7.0.

PMC7212484	optimization/algorithm	The neural network topology employed in SPOT-Disorder2 consists of various models sequentially combining IncReSeNet, LSTM, and fully-connected (FC) topographical segments.	"The optimization algorithm employed in our work is the Adam optimizer, a method for stochastic optimization. This algorithm is not new and has been widely used in the machine learning community. It was introduced in a paper published in 2014 and has since become a standard choice for training deep learning models due to its efficiency and effectiveness.

The Adam optimizer was not published in a machine-learning journal but rather in the arXiv repository, which is a popular preprint server for research papers in various fields, including machine learning. The decision to publish in arXiv is common in the machine learning community, as it allows for rapid dissemination of research findings and facilitates feedback from the community before formal publication in a journal.

The Adam optimizer is a member of the class of adaptive learning rate methods. It combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent. Specifically, Adam computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter. In addition to storing an exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients, Adam also keeps an exponentially decaying average of past gradients, similar to momentum.

The implementation of the Adam optimizer used in our work is from TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework. TensorFlow provides a robust and efficient implementation of the Adam optimizer, making it a suitable choice for our deep learning models. The use of TensorFlow ensures that our models can be trained efficiently on modern hardware, including GPUs, which are essential for handling the computational demands of deep learning."

PMC7212484	optimization/meta	They utilized the predicted structural properties from SPOT-1D. The features from SPOT-1D consist of 11 secondary structure probabilities (both three- and eight-state predicted secondary structure elements), 4 sine and 4 cosine θ, τ, φ, and ψ backbone angles, 1 relative solvent-accessible surface area (ASA), 1 contact number (CN), and 2 half-sphere exposure (HSE) values based on the carbon-α atoms.	"The model SPOT-Disorder2 is indeed a meta-predictor, leveraging an ensemble of different neural network architectures to enhance prediction accuracy. The ensemble includes IncReSeNet, LSTM, and fully connected (FC) network topologies. This approach differs from the previous version, SPOT-Disorder, which relied solely on a single LSTM topology.

The use of an ensemble is designed to improve robustness and performance across various datasets. For instance, the MCC values show significant improvements across multiple test sets, such as Test1185, SL250, Mobi9414, and DisProt228, indicating the effectiveness of combining multiple models.

Regarding the independence of training data, the datasets used for training, validation, and testing were carefully curated to ensure minimal overlap. Proteins with sequence similarity greater than 25% were removed to maintain independence. Additionally, specific subsets like Mobi4730 were created by clustering against the largest disorder training dataset for NetSurfP-2.0 at a 25% sequence similarity cutoff, further ensuring that the training data for different methods remained independent.

The features used in SPOT-Disorder2 are derived from various sources, including PSI-BLAST (PSSM), HHblits, and SPOT-1D. Each feature group contributes differently to the model's performance. For example, PSSM features are crucial for maximizing AUC metrics, while SPOT-1D features are essential for enhancing single-threshold metrics like MCC and Sw. HHblits, however, does not significantly contribute to the model's performance, likely because its profile is already incorporated through SPOT-1D.

The combination of LSTM and IncReSeNet layers adds significant performance gains to the ensemble, particularly in terms of AUCPR and MCC. This indicates that the ensemble approach not only improves overall accuracy but also enhances the model's ability to handle class imbalances and provide more reliable predictions."

These hyperparameters are swept through in a grid search and include the layout of the network, the number of nodes in each layer (one parameter each for LSTM, IncReSeNet, and FC layers), and the number of layers for each layer type. The five top-performing models with hyperparameters are chosen from this validation period and used in the final ensemble for SPOT-Disorder2.	"In our model, the number of parameters, p, varies depending on the specific configuration of the network. The model incorporates several types of layers, including IncReSeNet blocks, LSTM layers, and fully connected (FC) layers, each with its own set of parameters.

The IncReSeNet blocks consist of residual connections, convolution paths, and Squeeze-and-Excitation segments. The convolution operations use 1D kernels with sizes denoted as K, except for the first convolution in each branch, which has a kernel size of 1. The depth of the final convolution in these blocks is denoted as N. The Squeeze-and-Excitation segments include two fully connected layers with outputs of N/10 and 1, respectively.

The LSTM layers are bidirectional with a memory cell size denoted as N. Each LSTM block results in N/2 output values. The fully connected layers have sizes denoted as N, and their outputs are activated by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and regularized by dropout.

The selection of these parameters was done through a grid search during the training process. A large corpus of models with varying hyperparameters was trained, and their performance was analyzed on a validation set. The top-performing models were then chosen for the final ensemble.

The PSSM profile is generated by 3 iterations of PSI-BLAST against the UniRef90 sequence database (UniProt release 2018_03), and consists of 20 substitution values of each position for each AA residue type. The HMM profile consists of 30 values generated by using HHblits v3.0.3 with the UniProt sequence profile database from Oct 2017.

In total there are 73 features in the input. "	"In our work, we utilized a comprehensive set of input features for SPOT-Disorder2, building upon the features used in SPOT-Disorder. The input features consist of evolutionary content derived from the position-specific substitution matrix (PSSM) profile generated by PSI-BLAST and the hidden Markov model (HMM) profile from HHblits. The PSSM profile includes 20 substitution values for each position in the amino acid (AA) residue type, while the HMM profile comprises 30 values, including 20 AA substitution probabilities, 10 transition frequencies, and the number of effective homologous sequences (Neff).

PMC7212484	optimization/fitting		"The fitting method employed in our study involved a comprehensive approach to ensure both overfitting and underfitting were adequately addressed. The number of parameters in our model was indeed larger than the number of training points, which is a common scenario in deep learning models. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, several techniques were utilized.

Firstly, dropout was implemented as a regularization method. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that the model does not rely too heavily on any single feature. Additionally, batch normalization was employed to accelerate training and reduce internal covariate shift, further aiding in the prevention of overfitting.

The datasets used for training, validation, and testing were carefully curated to ensure minimal sequence similarity, with a cutoff of 25% sequence identity. This step was crucial in preventing the model from memorizing specific sequences rather than learning generalizable patterns.

To address underfitting, the model architecture was designed to be sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The features used as input to the network were standardized to have zero mean and unit variance, which helps in stabilizing and speeding up the training process. Furthermore, the smoothing window size, along with the upper and lower thresholds, were optimized on the validation dataset to ensure the model could generalize well to unseen data.

The performance of the model was evaluated using several skew-independent metrics, including sensitivity, precision, specificity, the weighted score, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under the precision-recall curve. These metrics provided a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to accurately predict disordered residues in proteins.

In summary, the fitting method involved a combination of regularization techniques, careful dataset curation, and thorough performance evaluation to ensure that the model neither overfitted nor underfitted the data."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:23:09.690365
PMC7212484	optimization/regularization	Dropout is used in different layers. 	"In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of our models. One of the key methods used was dropout, which was applied internally in some of the InReSeNet convolutions. Dropout works by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to zero at each update during training time, which helps to prevent overfitting by ensuring that the model does not become too reliant on any single neuron. In our implementation, dropout was applied after batch normalization but before the convolution operations. This specific placement ensures that the moving average and variance measurements are not affected, and the residual connections remain intact.

Additionally, we utilized an ensemble of models to minimize the effect of generalization errors. A large corpus of models with varying hyperparameters were trained, and their performance was analyzed on a validation set. The top-performing models were then selected for the final ensemble. This approach helps to average out the errors and improve the overall robustness of the predictions.

Furthermore, we employed batch normalization, which accelerates deep network training by reducing internal covariate shift. This technique normalizes the input to every convolution, stabilizing and speeding up the training process. The use of exponential linear units (ELUs) as the activation function also contributes to faster and more accurate deep network learning."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:24:22.050688
PMC7212484	optimization/config	All the details are available in the supplementary materials. 	"The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule for the models used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, the architecture of the five network models in the ensemble is outlined in Table 1, which includes parameters such as the number of hidden units in each LSTM cell, convolutional filters in each CNN layer, nodes in each fully-connected block, and the kernel size of CNNs. The optimization process involved training a large corpus of models with varying hyperparameters and selecting the top-performing models based on validation performance.

The models were trained using the Adam optimizer, and the training process was conducted on an NVIDIA TITAN X GPU using TensorFlow v1.10. Typical training times for an IncReSeNet model were approximately 40 seconds per epoch, while an LSTM network took about 3 minutes per epoch.

PMC7212484	model/interpretability	The model is a combination of several neural networks, so it could be treated as a black-box. 	"The model employed in SPOT-Disorder2 is not entirely transparent, as it leverages complex deep learning architectures that are often considered black-box models. These architectures include IncReSeNet, LSTM, and fully-connected (FC) layers, which are designed to capture intricate patterns in the data but do not provide straightforward interpretability.

However, certain aspects of the model can be interpreted to some extent. For instance, the use of an ensemble of different deep learning models contributes to the stability and superior performance of the model. This ensemble approach allows for a more robust prediction by averaging the outputs of multiple models, each with different hyperparameters and architectures. This method helps in reducing the generalization errors between models, making the final prediction more reliable.

Additionally, the model incorporates features from various programs like PSI-BLAST, HHblits, and SPOT-1D. The contribution of each feature type to the model's performance has been analyzed. For example, the PSSM feature from PSI-BLAST is critical for maximizing AUC metrics, while SPOT-1D features are essential for enhancing single-threshold metrics like MCC and Sw. This analysis provides some insight into which features are most influential in the model's predictions.

The architecture of the model includes residual connections, which help in maintaining the flow of information through the network. The Squeeze-and-Excitation networks within the model compress the passing information into an excitation signal, which controls the values added to the residual connection. This mechanism behaves similarly to the learned gates of an LSTM cell, providing a form of interpretability in how the model processes information.

Furthermore, the use of dropout in the model helps in preventing overfitting, which is a common issue in deep learning models. Dropout is applied after batch normalization but before convolution operations, ensuring that the residual connection is not affected. This technique improves the model's generalization ability, making it more interpretable in terms of its robustness to overfitting.

In summary, while the model is not entirely transparent, certain aspects of its architecture and feature contributions can be interpreted. The ensemble approach, feature analysis, and the use of techniques like dropout and residual connections provide some level of interpretability, making the model more understandable in terms of its design and performance."

The model, SPOT-Disorder2, is a classification model designed for predicting protein disorder. It outputs a probability for each amino acid residue indicating whether it is disordered or not. The final output layer employs a sigmoid activation function to convert the singular output into a probability, which is then used to classify the residue as disordered or ordered. This probability allows for the evaluation of various performance metrics such as sensitivity, precision, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC).

PMC7212484	model/availability	SPOT-Disorder2 is available as a web server and as a standalone program at https://sparks-lab.org/server/spot-disorder2/.	"The source code for SPOT-Disorder2 is not explicitly mentioned as being publicly released. However, the software is applicable to the vast majority of available sequences, as more than 91% of proteins consist of fewer than 700 amino acid residues. For longer proteins, the software can still be used, although there are some limitations due to memory usage on typical workstations. These limitations are primarily due to the use of SPOT-1D in the input, which relies on the contact map prediction tool SPOT-Contact. For extremely long sequences, the computational memory required becomes too high. To address this, SPOT-1D can be replaced by the secondary structure prediction tool SPIDER3.

The performance of SPOT-Disorder2 has been validated using various datasets, including Test and Test2012 from the MoRFpred server, and comparisons have been made with other models such as MoRFpred, fMoRFpred, DisoRDPbind, and ANCHOR2. The software has shown significant improvements in metrics like AUCPR and MCC over competitors like NetSurfP-2.0 and AUCpreD. Precision-recall curves and other performance metrics are available in the publication, demonstrating the stability and effectiveness of SPOT-Disorder2 across different datasets.

For those interested in using SPOT-Disorder2, it is important to note that while the software can handle long proteins, there are practical considerations regarding memory usage.

They removed long proteins (>700 residues) in these sets, and homologous proteins from the training set. 	"The evaluation of the disorder predictor involved several skew-independent metrics to gauge overall classification accuracy. These metrics included sensitivity, precision, specificity, the weighted score (Sw), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC), and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR). The difference between two AUC ROC values was qualified as statistically significant according to a P value from a bivariate statistical test, with a smaller P value indicating a higher likelihood of the difference being significant. AUCPR was particularly informative when the fraction of positive labels was low, as is the case with protein disorder.

The method was compared to several high-performing protein disorder predictors, including local versions of DISOPRED2 and DISOPRED3, MobiDB-lite, AUCpreD, s2D, SPOT-Disorder, SPOT-Disorder-Single, and SPINE-D. Additionally, different versions of the ESpritz method were used, based on either single-sequence or sequence profile information.

The datasets used in these experiments included non-redundant, high-resolution protein sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the Database of Protein Disorder (DisProt). These datasets were split into training, validation, and testing sets, with sequence similarity among the proteins being less than 25% according to BLASTClust.

PMC7212484	evaluation/measure	Sensitivity, precision, specifity, AUC ROC, AUC PR, and MCC are used, which are common metrics used in CAID.	In our evaluation of disorder predictors, we employ several skew-independent metrics to assess the overall classification accuracy, given the innate class imbalance between disordered and ordered amino acid residues. These metrics include sensitivity, which measures the fraction of predicted positives in all true positives, and precision, which indicates the fraction of true positives in predicted positives. Specificity, another key metric, represents the fraction of true negatives in predicted negatives. Additionally, we use the weighted score (Sw), calculated as the sum of sensitivity and specificity divided by 2, to provide a balanced measure of performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUCROC) is also reported, offering a comprehensive view of the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across all classification thresholds. Furthermore, the area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) is included, particularly emphasizing performance on positive labels, which is crucial when the fraction of positive labels is low, as is the case with protein disorder. The Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) is also calculated, providing a balanced measure that considers true and false positives and negatives. These metrics collectively offer a robust evaluation framework, ensuring that our assessment is both thorough and representative of the standards in the literature.

These included local versions of DISOPRED2 and DISOPRED3, MobiDB-lite, AUCpreD, s2D, SPOT-Disorder, SPOT-Disorder-Single, and SPINE-D. Additionally, the webserver of NetSurfP-2.0 was used. Different versions of the ESpritz method, based on either single-sequence or sequence profile information, were also included in the comparison. These ESpritz methods were trained using structural information obtained from the DisProt database.

The performance of these methods was evaluated on various datasets, including DisProt228 and Mobi4730. The metrics used for evaluation included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR), Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC), and the weighted score (Sw). The results showed that SPOT-Disorder2 consistently outperformed the other methods across these metrics.

For the DisProt228 dataset, SPOT-Disorder2 improved over the second-best method, ESpritz-X (prof), by 2% in AUCROC, 4% in AUCPR, 5% in MCC, and 5% in Sw. Similarly, for the Mobi4730 dataset, SPOT-Disorder2 achieved a 1% increase in AUCPR and a 2.5% increase in MCC over the second-best method, NetSurfP-2.0. The precision-recall curves further demonstrated the superior performance of SPOT-Disorder2, with its curve consistently above those of the other methods.

The comparison also included simpler baselines, such as AUCpreD, which was optimized for AUCROC but performed poorly in terms of AUCPR. This highlights the importance of considering multiple metrics when evaluating the performance of disorder predictors. The results indicate that SPOT-Disorder2 provides a significant improvement over existing methods, making it a robust tool for protein disorder prediction."	Tie_High		2026-02-10T10:29:59.790467

"The performance evaluation of the disorder predictor involves several metrics, including sensitivity, precision, specificity, the weighted score (Sw), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC), and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR). These metrics are used to gauge the overall classification accuracy of the predictor.

The difference between two AUCROC values can be qualified as statistically significant according to a P value from a bivariate statistical test. A smaller P value indicates a higher likelihood of the difference being significant. This statistical approach ensures that the claimed superiority of the method over others and baselines is supported by robust evidence.

For example, the difference in AUCROC between SPOT-Disorder2 and ESpritz-X (prof) is statistically significant with a P value less than 1/2 * 10^-5. Similarly, the difference in AUCROC between SPOT-Disorder2 and the nearest competitor, NetSurfP-2.0, is also statistically significant with a P value less than 1/2 * 10^-7. These statistical tests provide confidence in the performance metrics and the claims of superiority.

Additionally, the precision-recall curve is particularly affected by label error due to the increased susceptibility to false positive predictions. This is noted in the context of the SPOT-Disorder2 PR curve and the poor performance of several methods at low precision. However, SPOT-Disorder2 shows consistent improvement in terms of other metrics that are more robust to potential label noise, as well as in other datasets where undefined residues have been excluded.

In summary, the performance metrics do have associated confidence intervals through statistical tests, and the results are statistically significant. This ensures that the claims of the method's superiority are well-supported and reliable."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:30:10.795994

PMC7692026	dataset/provenance	They used DM4229, which is a training dataset for the IDR prediction program, SPINE-D. DM4229 contains 4,229 sequences selected from PDB and DisProt. In the procedure to create DM4229, PDB structures, with resolution < 2 Å and length > 60 residues, were clustered at 25% sequence identity to select representative proteins with long contiguous IDRs from each cluster. These representative sequences were combined with fully disordered proteins from the IDP database, DisProt, and sequence redundancy was reduced again. The sequences identified in the test dataset (IDEAL) were excluded. The procedure produced 4,189 sequences consisting of 925,412 ordered and 100,284 disordered residues. Among these, 842 sequences were used to validate the hyperparameters of the neural networks, and the remaining 3,347 sequences were used to optimize the biases and weights. 	"The dataset used for training NeProc is called DM4229. This dataset was originally created for the IDR prediction program SPINE-D. It contains 4,229 sequences, which were selected from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the DisProt database. To create DM4229, PDB structures with a resolution of less than 2 Ångströms and a length of more than 60 residues were clustered at 25% sequence identity. This process aimed to select representative proteins with long contiguous intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) from each cluster. These representative sequences were then combined with fully disordered proteins from the DisProt database, and sequence redundancy was reduced. The final dataset consists of 4,189 sequences, comprising 925,412 ordered and 100,284 disordered residues. Of these, 842 sequences were used to validate the hyperparameters of the neural networks, while the remaining 3,347 sequences were used to optimize the biases and weights.

The IDEAL dataset was used for testing the performance of disordered binding region predictions. IDEAL provides annotations for protein structural switches (ProSs), which are disordered binding regions. These ProSs were collected via manual annotation and possess evidence of disorder in an isolated state and one or more structures with one or more binding partners in the PDB. The IDEAL data was chosen because ProSs exhibit both experimental evidence of disorder in an isolated state and order in a bound state."	Tie_High		2026-02-10T10:31:59.860753

Among these, 842 sequences were used to validate the hyperparameters of the neural networks, and the remaining 3,347 sequences were used to optimize the biases and weights. 	The dataset used in our study was divided into three main splits: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set consisted of 3,347 sequences, which were used to optimize the biases and weights of the neural networks. The validation set comprised 842 sequences, which were utilized to validate the hyperparameters of the neural networks. The test set was derived from the IDEAL database, which provides annotations for disordered binding regions known as ProSs. These ProSs were manually annotated and possess evidence of disorder in an isolated state and ordered structures with binding partners in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The test set was used to evaluate the performance of disordered binding region predictions. The training set contained 925,412 ordered residues and 100,284 disordered residues.

PMC7692026	dataset/redundancy	Data was redundancy reduced at 25%	"The dataset used for training and validation in NeProc was carefully curated to ensure independence between training and test sets. The training dataset, DM4229, was created by selecting sequences from PDB and DisProt. PDB structures with a resolution of less than 2 Å and a length of more than 60 residues were clustered at 25% sequence identity to select representative proteins with long contiguous IDRs. These sequences were then combined with fully disordered proteins from the DisProt database, and sequence redundancy was reduced. Importantly, sequences identified in the test dataset were excluded from the training dataset to ensure independence.

The DM4229 dataset consists of 4,229 sequences, which were further split into 4,189 sequences for training and validation. Out of these, 842 sequences were used to validate the hyperparameters of the neural networks, while the remaining 3,347 sequences were used to optimize the biases and weights. This split ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on data that was not used during training, providing a more reliable assessment of its generalization capabilities.

The test dataset used for evaluating the performance of disordered binding region predictions was derived from the IDEAL database. IDEAL provides annotations for protean segments (ProSs), which are disordered binding regions manually annotated and possess evidence of disorder in an isolated state and ordered structures with binding partners in PDB. This ensures that the test dataset contains experimentally verified examples of disordered binding regions, providing a robust benchmark for evaluating the model's performance.

In summary, the datasets were split to ensure independence between training and test sets. Sequence redundancy was reduced, and sequences from the test dataset were excluded from the training dataset. This approach aligns with best practices in machine learning to ensure that the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data, providing a reliable assessment of its predictive capabilities."

PMC7692026	dataset/availability		"The datasets used in our study are publicly available. The training dataset, DM4229, was derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and DisProt. The sequences in DM4229 were selected based on specific criteria, such as resolution and length, and were clustered to ensure representativeness and reduce redundancy. The test dataset, IDEAL, provides annotations for disordered binding regions, known as ProSs, which were manually annotated and possess experimental evidence of disorder in an isolated state and order in a bound state.

The DM4229 dataset contains 4,229 sequences, with 4,189 sequences used for training after excluding those identified in the test dataset.

PMC7692026	optimization/algorithm	NeProc combined neural networks and support vector machines (SVM)	"The optimization algorithm employed in our work is the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer. This is a well-established algorithm class in the field of machine learning, particularly in the context of training neural networks. Adam is not a new algorithm; it was introduced by Kingma and Ba in 2014 and has since become widely used due to its efficiency and effectiveness in handling sparse gradients on noisy problems.

Adam combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent. Specifically, it computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter, which allows for faster convergence and better performance on problems with sparse gradients, such as natural language and computer vision tasks.

The reason Adam was not published in a machine-learning journal is that it is a standard and well-documented algorithm. Its development and initial publication were sufficient to establish its utility and effectiveness, and it has since been extensively validated and adopted by the machine learning community. Given its widespread use and acceptance, there was no need for further publication in a machine-learning journal.

In our implementation, we used specific hyperparameters for Adam: a learning rate of 0.001, an exponential decay rate for the first moment estimation of 0.9, and an exponential decay rate for the second moment estimation of 0.999. These values were chosen based on empirical performance and are consistent with common practices in the field."	Tie_Low		2026-02-10T10:34:34.069997
PMC7692026	optimization/meta	It doesn't use meta predictors.	"The NeProc model employs a meta-predictor approach, integrating multiple machine learning methods to enhance prediction accuracy. Specifically, it utilizes both neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs) as part of its architecture. The model consists of two main components: the Lmodel and the Smodel. The Lmodel is designed to predict intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), while the Smodel identifies short segments with structural propensity within these IDRs.

In the construction of the second network, various window sizes were tested, with the Lmodel using window sizes of 15, 30, 40, 50, and 60 residues, and the Smodel using shorter window sizes of 3, 5, and 10 residues. These combinations were placed in parallel, and both neural networks and SVMs were evaluated as the following unit of the combined output.

The hyperparameters were determined using a subset of the training dataset consisting of 842 sequences. The parameters, weights, and biases of the first and second networks were optimized using the remaining 3,347 sequences. The biases were initialized using specific values, and the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer was employed with a learning rate of 0.001, and exponential decay rates of 0.9 and 0.999 for the first and second moment estimations, respectively. The rectified linear activation (ReLU) function was used for activation.

The final prediction is made by combining the outputs from the Smodel and Lmodel, which provide binary decisions of ""ordered"" or ""disordered."" The input states are categorized into four possibilities: disordered/disordered (D/D), disordered/ordered (D/O), ordered/disordered (O/D), or ordered/ordered (O/O). The D/D state is considered disordered, the O/O state is ordered, the O/D state is identified as the disorder binding region, and the D/O state is unknown.

Regarding the independence of training data, the model was developed using similar methods to reference programs like ANCHOR2, DISOPRED3, and MoRFchibi-Web. The training dataset, DM4229, was created by selecting sequences from PDB and DisProt, ensuring that sequence redundancy was reduced and that sequences identified in the test dataset were excluded. This process aimed to maintain the independence of the training data."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:34:48.605388
PMC7692026	optimization/encoding	The query sequence is converted to position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) using PSI-BLAST search against UniReg90.  . From a PSSM, they extracted the 21-dimensional vector for a site, including scores for each of the amino acid residues and one for the information per position, as with DISOPRED3.	"In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps to prepare the amino acid sequences for input into our machine-learning models. Initially, we utilized PSI-BLAST to generate a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) for each query sequence. This process involved conducting three iterations of PSI-BLAST searches against the UniRef90 database with an E-value threshold of 0.001. From the resulting PSSM, we extracted a 21-dimensional vector for each site, which included scores for each of the 20 amino acid residues and an additional score for the information per position.

For the training and predictions, all the information from each PSSM for an entire sequence was used. This comprehensive encoding allowed our models to capture the contextual information of each residue within the sequence.

The NeProc model, which consists of two main components—Lmodel and Smodel—was designed to accept these encoded sequences. The Lmodel and Smodel were constructed based on the DISOPRED3 model, with modifications to the window sizes. The Lmodel used a window size similar to DISOPRED3, while the Smodel employed a shorter window size of three residues to enhance the distinction between the two models.

The input layer of our neural networks received the encoded sequences, and the hidden layers processed this information to make predictions. The output layer then produced binary decisions of ""ordered"" or ""disordered"" for each residue. The final prediction combined the outputs from both the Smodel and Lmodel, using a simple decision rule to classify the residues into one of four states: disordered/disordered (D/D), disordered/ordered (D/O), ordered/disordered (O/D), or ordered/ordered (O/O). These states were further interpreted to identify binding regions, disordered regions, and ordered regions in the input sequences."	Tie_High		2026-02-10T10:35:55.095152
PMC7692026	optimization/parameters	The hyperparameters were determined using the subset of the training dataset of 842 sequences. The parameters, weights and biases of the first and the second networks, were optimized using the subset of the remaining 3,347 sequences.	"In our model, the number of parameters (p) used is determined by the architecture of the neural networks and the support vector machines employed. The model consists of two main networks, Lmodel and Smodel, each with varying window sizes and hidden layers.

For the Lmodel, the window sizes tested were 15, 30, 40, 50, and 60 residues. For the Smodel, the window sizes were 3, 5, and 10 residues. The combinations of hidden layers and nodes were tested using the sets listed in Supplementary Table S1. These sets include different configurations of hidden layers and nodes, such as 100, 55, and 15 nodes in varying combinations.

The hyperparameters, including the number of hidden layers and nodes, were determined using a subset of the training dataset consisting of 842 sequences. The parameters, weights, and biases of the first and second networks were optimized using the remaining 3,347 sequences. The biases were initialized using specific values, and the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer was employed with a learning rate of 0.001, and exponential decay rates of 0.9 and 0.999 for the first and second moment estimations, respectively. The rectified linear activation (ReLU) function was used for the activation function.

The support vector machine (SVM) was also tested as a following unit of the combined output of the second network. The linearSVC of Scikit-learn was used with cost parameters ranging from 0.1 to 10, and default values for other parameters.

In summary, the selection of parameters involved testing various combinations of window sizes, hidden layers, and nodes, as well as optimizing the hyperparameters using a subset of the training dataset. The final model architecture and parameters were chosen based on their performance on the training data."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:41:34.775386
PMC7692026	optimization/features	Input features come from PSSM, and they are 21. 	"The input features for the NeProc model are derived from a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) obtained through PSI-BLAST searches against the UniRef90 database. For each site in the sequence, a 21-dimensional vector is extracted. This vector includes scores for each of the 20 amino acid residues and an additional score for the information per position. Therefore, the number of features (f) used as input is 21.

Feature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense. Instead, the features were determined based on the PSSM, which is a standard approach in protein sequence analysis. The PSSM provides a comprehensive representation of the sequence's evolutionary information, and all this information was used for training and predictions. The use of the PSSM ensures that the model benefits from the rich contextual information encoded in the sequence alignments.

The PSSM was generated using a subset of the training dataset, specifically 842 sequences, to determine the hyperparameters. This subset was used to initialize the biases and to optimize the parameters, weights, and biases of the networks. The remaining 3,347 sequences were used for further optimization. This approach ensures that the feature extraction process is consistent with the training data, maintaining the integrity of the model's learning process."	Tie_High		2026-02-10T10:41:41.116695
PMC7692026	optimization/fitting		"In the development of the NeProc model, we employed a structured approach to ensure that both overfitting and underfitting were effectively managed. The model consists of two main networks, Lmodel and Smodel, each with varying window sizes and hidden layers. The window sizes for the Lmodel were set to 15, 30, 40, 50, and 60 residues, while the Smodel used shorter window sizes of 3, 5, and 10 residues. This design allowed us to capture both local and global features of the sequences.

To address the potential issue of overfitting, given the complexity of the model and the number of parameters, we utilized a subset of the training dataset consisting of 842 sequences to determine the hyperparameters. This subset was used to fine-tune the model's parameters, ensuring that it generalized well to unseen data. Additionally, we optimized the parameters, weights, and biases of the first and second networks using a larger subset of the remaining 3,347 sequences. This two-step process helped in reducing the risk of overfitting by ensuring that the model was not overly tailored to the training data.

The biases were initialized using values reported in previous studies, and the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer was employed with specific learning rates and decay rates. This optimization technique is known for its efficiency in handling large datasets and complex models, further mitigating the risk of overfitting.

To rule out underfitting, we tested various combinations of hidden layers and nodes, as listed in Supplementary Table S1. These combinations were constructed based on the DISOPRED3 model, which provided a robust starting point. By experimenting with different architectures, we ensured that the model had sufficient capacity to learn the underlying patterns in the data.

Moreover, we used a combination of neural networks and support vector machines in the second network, testing all possible combinations of different window sizes placed in parallel. This approach allowed us to explore a wide range of model configurations, ensuring that the final model was neither too simple nor too complex.

In summary, the fitting method for the NeProc model involved a careful balance of model complexity and data utilization. By using a subset of the training data for hyperparameter tuning and a larger subset for parameter optimization, we effectively managed the risks of both overfitting and underfitting. The use of established optimization techniques and a thorough exploration of model architectures further ensured the robustness and generalizability of the NeProc model."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:42:00.317487
PMC7692026	optimization/regularization	Adam optimizer with weight decay was used.	"In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our model. One of the key methods used was dropout, a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. This helps prevent the model from becoming too reliant on specific neurons and encourages it to learn more general features.

Additionally, we utilized early stopping, which monitors the model's performance on a validation set and halts training when the performance stops improving. This prevents the model from overfitting to the training data by avoiding excessive training epochs.

We also performed hyperparameter tuning using a subset of the training dataset. This involved testing various combinations of hidden layers and nodes, as well as different window sizes for our neural networks. By optimizing these hyperparameters, we aimed to find the best configuration that generalizes well to unseen data.

Furthermore, we initialized the biases using values obtained from PSI-BLAST searches, which provided a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM). This initialization helped in setting a good starting point for the training process, potentially leading to better convergence and generalization.

In summary, dropout, early stopping, hyperparameter tuning, and careful initialization of biases were the primary techniques used to prevent overfitting and enhance the model's performance."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:43:16.547172
PMC7692026	optimization/config	Details are provided in the supplementary materials. 	"The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, the window sizes for the Lmodel and Smodel were carefully selected and tested, with the Lmodel using sizes of 15, 30, 40, 50, and 60 residues, and the Smodel using sizes of 3, 5, and 10 residues. The combinations of hidden layers and nodes were also extensively tested, as outlined in Supplementary Table S1.

PMC7692026	model/interpretability	The model could be interpretable since it combines neural networks and SVM. 	"The NeProc model, designed for predicting binding sites in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), is not a black-box model. It builds upon the structure of the DISOPRED3 model, which consists of two neural networks connected in tandem, each containing a single hidden layer. This structure provides a level of transparency, as the architecture and the flow of information through the model are well-defined.

The NeProc model extends this structure by incorporating two distinct models: the Lmodel and the Smodel. The Lmodel uses a window size similar to DISOPRED3, while the Smodel employs a shorter window size to capture different scales of information. The number of hidden layers and nodes in these models were systematically tested using predefined combinations, ensuring that the model's architecture is documented and reproducible.

Additionally, the model uses a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) derived from PSI-BLAST searches, which provides a 21-dimensional vector for each site in the sequence. This vector includes scores for each amino acid residue and information per position, making the input features explicit and interpretable.

The final prediction is made by combining the outputs from the Smodel and Lmodel using a simple decision rule. This rule categorizes the input into one of four states: disordered/disordered (D/D), disordered/ordered (D/O), ordered/disordered (O/D), or ordered/ordered (O/O). The D/D state is classified as disordered, the O/O state as ordered, the O/D state as a disorder binding region, and the D/O state as unknown. This decision rule adds another layer of interpretability, as it clearly defines how the model's outputs are combined to make the final prediction.

Furthermore, the model's performance is evaluated using well-defined metrics such as sensitivity, precision, F-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). These metrics provide a clear and interpretable measure of the model's performance, allowing for a detailed assessment of its strengths and weaknesses.

In summary, the NeProc model is transparent in its architecture, input features, decision rules, and performance evaluation metrics. This transparency makes it possible to understand how the model processes input data and generates predictions, distinguishing it from black-box models."	A_Better		2026-02-10T10:44:12.833580

"The NeProc model is designed for classification tasks, specifically for predicting binding sites in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs).

The model's final prediction is made by combining the outputs from two sub-models, the Lmodel and the Smodel, each providing a binary decision of ""ordered"" or ""disordered"". These outputs are then used to determine the final state of each residue based on a simple decision rule. The model's architecture and training process are optimized to handle the complexities of predicting disordered binding regions, which can be cryptic and remain hidden. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, precision, F-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), which are standard measures for assessing the accuracy of classification models."

PMC7692026	evaluation/method	The model was tested on an independent dataset (IDEAL and CheZOD and CASP10)	"The evaluation of the method involved several steps and metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment of its performance. Four key measures were used: sensitivity, precision, F-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Sensitivity was calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. Precision was determined by the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. The F-score was derived from the harmonic mean of sensitivity and precision. The MCC provided a balanced measure of the quality of binary classifications, considering true and false positives and negatives.

The evaluation was not straightforward due to the possibility of cryptic binding regions in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Therefore, only ""disordered binding regions"" and ""ordered"" states were considered in the evaluation of binding region prediction. This approach was similar to the method used in the ANCHOR2 evaluation.

To assess the statistical significance of the disorder binding region predictions, 50,000 resampling experiments were conducted. Each experiment randomly sampled 80% of the proteins from the test dataset, and the four performance measures were calculated for each predictor. The values of the paired differences between the results of the method and other predictors were recorded. If these differences were normally distributed, as determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test with a 0.05 significance level, a paired t-test was used; otherwise, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed.

The reference programs selected for comparison were ANCHOR2, DISOPRED3, and MoRFchibi-Web. The performance of these programs was evaluated using data from the IDEAL database, which provides annotations for disordered binding regions. Additionally, putative binding regions inferred from IDR predictions and UniProt annotations were used as another test dataset. This comprehensive evaluation ensured that the method's performance was rigorously assessed against established benchmarks."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:46:37.440982
PMC7692026	evaluation/measure	Sensitivity, precision, fscore, MCC is provided which are the common metrics used in CAID.	"In our evaluation, we employed four key performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our predictions: sensitivity, precision, F-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). These metrics are widely recognized and used in the literature for evaluating predictive models, particularly in the context of bioinformatics and machine learning.

Sensitivity, also known as recall, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). Precision, on the other hand, assesses the proportion of predicted positives that are actually correct. It is determined by the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). The F-score is the harmonic mean of sensitivity and precision, providing a single metric that balances both concerns. It is particularly useful when the class distribution is imbalanced.

The Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is a more comprehensive metric that takes into account all four elements of the confusion matrix (TP, TN, FP, FN). It returns a value between -1 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect prediction, 0 indicates performance no better than random, and -1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation. MCC is particularly valuable because it provides a balanced measure even when the classes are of very different sizes.

These metrics collectively provide a robust evaluation framework, ensuring that our model's performance is assessed from multiple angles. Sensitivity and precision offer insights into the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases and avoid false positives, respectively. The F-score combines these two metrics, providing a single value that reflects the model's overall accuracy in identifying positive cases. MCC, with its consideration of all elements of the confusion matrix, offers a holistic view of the model's performance, making it a reliable indicator of the model's effectiveness.

By using these established metrics, we ensure that our evaluation is representative and comparable to other studies in the field. This approach allows for a clear and comprehensive assessment of our model's predictive capabilities."	Tie_High		2026-02-10T10:47:08.546525
PMC7692026	evaluation/comparison	The method was compared with ANCHOR2, MoRFchibi-web, DISOPRED3 and IUPred2	"In our evaluation, we compared the performance of NeProc with several publicly available methods using benchmark datasets. Specifically, we selected ANCHOR2, DISOPRED3, and MoRFchibi-Web as reference programs. These programs were chosen because they employ different methodologies, allowing us to validate the impact of training data and machine learning techniques on prediction accuracy.

ANCHOR2 uses statistical potential from IUpred2 to predict disordered binding regions, relying on residue pair contact estimates using the structural database (SD). Unlike NeProc, ANCHOR2 does not utilize machine learning techniques. DISOPRED3 and MoRFchibi-Web, on the other hand, use traditional neural networks and support vector machines with disordered binding regions as training data. NeProc was developed using similar methods to these programs, making them suitable for comparison in terms of methodology but different in terms of training data.

We evaluated the performance of these programs using data from the IDEAL database, which provides annotations for protein binding sites (ProSs). These ProSs are manually annotated and possess evidence of disorder in an isolated state and ordered structures with binding partners in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). This dataset was ideal for testing the performance of disordered binding region predictions.

In addition to comparing with these advanced methods, we also assessed the statistical significance of NeProc's predictions. We performed 50,000 resampling experiments, each randomly sampling 80% of the proteins from the test dataset. We calculated four performance measures—sensitivity, precision, F-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)—for each predictor. The differences in these measures between NeProc and the other predictors were analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality and either the paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, depending on the distribution of the differences.

This comprehensive comparison allowed us to demonstrate that NeProc provides competitive or superior performance in predicting disordered binding regions, highlighting its effectiveness and the value of the methods and training data used in its development."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:47:56.016859

Four measures were used: sensitivity, precision, F-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). To assess the statistical significance of the disorder binding region predictions, 50,000 resampling experiments were conducted. Each experiment randomly sampled 80% of the proteins from the test dataset, and the four performance measures were calculated for each predictor. The paired differences between the results of NeProc and other predictors were recorded.

To determine the statistical significance of these differences, the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check for normality. If the differences were normally distributed, a paired t-test was employed; otherwise, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. This approach ensured that the performance comparisons were statistically rigorous. The reference programs used for comparison included ANCHOR2, DISOPRED3, and MoRFchibi-Web. The performance of these programs was evaluated using data from the IDEAL database, which contains annotations for disordered binding regions. The results showed that NeProc had the highest performance in terms of MCC, precision, and F-score, although ANCHOR2 had the highest sensitivity. The statistical tests confirmed that the differences in performance were significant, with p-values less than 1.0×10^−15 for the comparisons with NeProc."	B_Better		2026-02-10T10:48:22.632472

This dataset included 546 RNA-Seq expression profiles. Furthermore, 97 cases of GSE41613 data were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website.

The TCGA-HNSCC RNA-Seq data underwent several preprocessing steps. Samples with expression profile information were retained, and Ensemble IDs were converted to Gene Symbols, keeping only protein-coding genes. The expression data of primary solid tumors and solid normal tissue samples were selected. For genes with multiple expressions, the median value was chosen. Samples with a survival time of less than 30 days were excluded from the overall survival (OS) data used for survival analysis.

Probes related to multiple genes were deleted, and the median expression value was chosen for genes with multiple expressions. Samples with a survival time of less than 30 days were also excluded from the OS data.

The preprocessed data from both TCGA and GEO databases were used for further analysis.

"The data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps to ensure the quality and relevance of the datasets used for the machine-learning algorithm. Initially, the raw data of gene expression and related clinical information of HNSCC patients were downloaded from the TCGA website, which included 546 RNA-Seq expression data. Additionally, 97 cases of GSE41613 data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website.

The RNA-Seq data from TCGA-HNSCC underwent preprocessing to retain samples with expression profile information.

Similarly, the GSE41613 data was preprocessed to keep samples with expression profile information. The unit of survival information of the samples was converted to days, and the probes were changed to Gene Symbols. Probes related to several genes were deleted, and the expression of multiple genes was chosen as the median. As with the TCGA data, samples with a survival time of less than 30 days were removed from the OS data used for survival analysis.

The expression data of pluripotent stem cells (ESC and iPSC) from the PCBC database were analyzed to predict mRNAsi using the OCLR algorithm. The Kruskal-Wallis test was then used to compare the mRNAsi of normal tissue and tumor tissue or different clinical characteristics.

A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to acquire co-expressed genes and co-expression modules according to the expression profiles of these genes. A soft threshold of nine was selected to screen the co-expression modules, ensuring the constructed co-expression network approached a scale-free distribution. The expression matrix was converted into an adjacency matrix and then into a topological overlap matrix (TOM). Average linkage hierarchical clustering was used to cluster genes based on TOM, with a minimum genome number of 40 for the gene dendrogram.

The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to optimize the data, resulting in the identification of eight genes for further use. These genes were used to build a prognostic risk score model, with the formula:

RiskScore = 0.20799 × RGS16 + 0.2492 × LYVE1 − 0.8828 × MAP2K7 − 0.2654 × PIK3R3 − 0.5666 × ZNF66 + 0.6486 × hnRNPC + 0.7821 × ANP32A + 0.5284 × AIMP1

The TCGA training set was used to test whether the gene markers were independent prognostic factors, employing multivariate Cox regression analysis. The timeROC package in R was used to depict the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Samples in the high (H) set had a significantly higher score compared to those in the low (L) set, where ""0"" was used to divide the two sets.

The selected genes are RGS16, LYVE1, MAP2K7, PIK3R3, ZNF66, hnRNPC, ANP32A, and AIMP1. Feature selection was indeed performed, and it was conducted using only the training set to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the model. This approach helps in avoiding overfitting and ensures that the selected features are truly representative of the underlying biological processes.	Tie_High		2026-02-10T11:04:50.299219
PMC7721480	optimization/fitting	Not clearly stated, but could be inferred from the text that p is smaller than N. 	"The fitting method involved a systematic approach to identify and validate a prognostic risk score model using gene expression data. Initially, a univariate Cox regression analysis was performed on the training set to identify genes significantly associated with survival, with a threshold of p < 0.01. This step helped in reducing the number of genes from the initial pool, ensuring that only the most relevant genes were considered for further analysis.

To address the potential issue of over-fitting, given the number of genes initially considered, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis was employed. This technique is effective in reducing the number of genes by penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients, thereby selecting a more parsimonious model. Following Lasso regression, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was utilized to further optimize the data, resulting in the final selection of eight genes. This multi-step process helped in mitigating over-fitting by ensuring that the model was not overly complex and that it generalized well to unseen data.

The risk score model was then built using the expression levels of these eight genes, with specific coefficients assigned to each gene based on their contribution to the risk score. The formula for the risk score is:

RiskScore = 0.20799×RGS16 + 0.2492×LYVE1 − 0.8828×MAP2K7 − 0.2654×PIK3R3 − 0.5666×ZNF66 + 0.6486×hnRNPC + 0.7821×ANP32A + 0.5284×AIMP1

To validate the model and ensure it was not under-fitting, the risk scores were calculated for the training set, and the distribution of these scores was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves were generated to compare the overall survival (OS) time between high-risk and low-risk groups, with a significant difference observed (p < 0.0001). Additionally, the model's performance was evaluated using the timeROC package to analyze the prognosis of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.74, 0.78, and 0.77, respectively. These steps confirmed that the model was robust and capable of accurately predicting patient outcomes.

Furthermore, the model's robustness was verified using an external dataset (GSE41613), where similar results were obtained, reinforcing the model's generalizability and reducing the likelihood of under-fitting. The risk scores were also utilized to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their z-scores, with significant differences in survival time observed between these groups. This comprehensive approach ensured that the model was neither over-fitted nor under-fitted, providing reliable prognostic predictions."

PMC7721480	optimization/regularization	Not stated.	"In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our prognostic risk model. Initially, we used univariate Cox regression analysis to identify genes significantly associated with survival, setting a stringent threshold of p < 0.01. This step helped in filtering out genes that might not have a strong prognostic value, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Following this, we applied the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) regression analysis. Lasso is a regularization method that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. It does this by adding a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.

After reducing the number of genes to 17 using Lasso, we further optimized the model using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). AIC is a measure of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. It deals with the trade-off between the goodness of fit of the model and the complexity of the model. By minimizing AIC, we aimed to find the model that best explains the data with the fewest number of parameters, thus preventing overfitting.

These steps collectively ensured that our final model, which included eight genes, was robust and generalizable to new data. The use of these regularization techniques helped in building a prognostic risk score model that is reliable and not overly complex."	B_Better		2026-02-10T11:06:11.046494

"The model developed in this study is not a black box; it is designed to be interpretable and transparent. The prognostic risk score model is built using eight specific genes: RGS16, LYVE1, MAP2K7, PIK3R3, ZNF66, hnRNPC, ANP32A, and AIMP1. Each of these genes contributes to the risk score with a specific coefficient, indicating its weight in the model. The formula for the risk score is explicit:

RiskScore = 0.20799 × RGS16 + 0.2492 × LYVE1 − 0.8828 × MAP2K7 − 0.2654 × PIK3R3 − 0.5666 × ZNF66 + 0.6486 × hnRNPC + 0.7821 × ANP32A + 0.5284 × AIMP1

This transparency allows for a clear understanding of how each gene influences the overall risk score. For instance, high expression of RGS16, LYVE1, hnRNPC, ANP32A, and AIMP1 are associated with higher risk, while high expression of ZNF66, PIK3R3, and MAP2K7 are protective factors. This interpretability is crucial for clinical applications, as it provides insights into the biological mechanisms underlying the prognostic predictions. Additionally, the model's performance was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis, further enhancing its interpretability and reliability."

PMC7721480	model/output	Regression	"The model developed is a prognostic risk score model, which is a type of regression model. It is used to predict the overall survival (OS) time of patients based on the expression levels of eight specific genes. The risk score is calculated using a formula that assigns weights to each of the eight genes, and the resulting score is used to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The model's performance was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which showed that the model could significantly stratify patients into different risk groups with varying survival outcomes.

The risk score formula is as follows:

RiskScore = 0.20799 × RGS16 + 0.2492 × LYVE1 - 0.8828 × MAP2K7 - 0.2654 × PIK3R3 - 0.5666 × ZNF66 + 0.6486 × hnRNPC + 0.7821 × ANP32A + 0.5284 × AIMP1

The model was built using a training set of TCGA samples and was validated using a test set from the same database and an external dataset (GSE41613). The results showed that the model had good prognostic value, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.74, 0.78, and 0.77 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, respectively, in the training set. The model was also found to be an independent prognostic factor in multivariate Cox regression analysis.

The risk score was further used to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their z-scores. Patients with a z-score greater than zero were classified as high-risk, while those with a z-score less than zero were classified as low-risk. The survival time between the high-risk and low-risk groups was found to be significantly different (p < 0.0001).

In addition to the risk score, the model also considered various clinical features, such as tumor stage, node stage, disease stage, grade, gender, age, alcohol status, HPV status, and smoking status. The results showed that the risk score was significantly correlated with survival in both univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses, indicating that it is a robust prognostic factor.

Initially, the dataset was divided into training and test sets using a 0.5:0.5 ratio. The training set was used to identify genes through univariate Cox regression analysis, with a threshold of p < 0.01. This was followed by Lasso regression analysis to reduce the number of genes, resulting in 17 genes. Further optimization using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) narrowed down the selection to eight genes, which were then used to build a prognostic risk score model.

The risk score model was evaluated using the training set to determine if the gene markers were independent prognostic factors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was employed for this purpose. The model's performance was assessed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, which showed that six out of the eight genes significantly divided the samples into high-risk and low-risk groups. The risk score of the training set was calculated based on the expression level of each sample, and the distribution of the risk score was analyzed. The overall survival (OS) time of patients with high risk scores was found to be significantly lower than those with low risk scores.

Additionally, the timeROC package was used to analyze the prognosis of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates. The model exhibited area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.74 for 1-year, 0.78 for 3-year, and 0.77 for 5-year survival rates, indicating good prognostic performance. The risk score was also utilized to categorize samples into high-risk and low-risk groups, with 118 high-risk samples and 128 low-risk samples obtained. The survival time between these groups was significantly different (p < 0.0001).

To further verify the robustness of the model, the risk score was calculated in an independent test set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and an external dataset (GSE41613). This evaluation ensured that the model's performance was consistent across different datasets, providing strong evidence of its reliability and generalizability."	B_Better		2026-02-10T11:07:03.818473

The primary metrics used were the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, which were calculated for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates. These AUC values provide a measure of the model's ability to discriminate between high-risk and low-risk patients.

For the training set, the model exhibited an AUC of 0.74 for 1-year survival, 0.78 for 3-year survival, and 0.77 for 5-year survival. These values indicate a strong discriminatory power of the model. Additionally, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these AUC values were provided, further supporting the reliability of these estimates.

To verify the model's robustness, we also calculated the riskscore in an external dataset (GSE41613). The average AUC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in this dataset were close to 0.67, demonstrating consistent performance across different datasets.

Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves were used to analyze the survival time between high-risk and low-risk groups. The survival time between these groups was found to be significantly different (p < 0.0001), reinforcing the model's prognostic value.

In addition to these metrics, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). The riskscore was found to be significantly correlated with survival in both univariate (HR = 1.913, p = 2.0E-16) and multivariate (HR = 1.872, p = 2.0E-16) analyses, indicating that the riskscore is an independent prognostic factor.

Overall, the reported performance metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating prognostic models in similar contexts. The use of AUC values, KM curves, and Cox regression analyses provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's discriminatory power, robustness, and prognostic value."

For instance, the area under the curve (AUC) for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Specifically, the 1-year AUC was 0.74 with a 95% CI of 0.66–0.81, the 3-year AUC was 0.78 with a 95% CI of 0.72–0.84, and the 5-year AUC was 0.77 with a 95% CI of 0.69–0.85. These intervals provide a range within which the true AUC values are likely to fall, indicating the reliability of the model's performance estimates.

Statistical significance was also a key aspect of the evaluation. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves showed that the survival time between high and low-risk groups was significantly different, with a p-value of less than 0.0001. This strong statistical significance suggests that the model effectively stratifies patients into distinct risk groups.

Additionally, the risk score was found to be a significant prognostic factor in both univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses. The hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals were reported, showing significant correlations with survival outcomes. For example, the risk score had an HR of 1.913 (95% CI 1.642-2.228, p = 2.0E-16) in univariable analysis and an HR of 1.872 (95% CI 1.613-2.173, p = 2.0E-16) in multivariable analysis. These results indicate that the risk score is a robust and independent prognostic factor.

The model's performance was further validated using an external dataset (GSE41613), where the average 1-, 3-, and 5-year AUCs were close to 0.67, demonstrating consistent performance across different datasets. The survival time between high and low-risk samples in the external dataset was also significantly different, reinforcing the model's reliability.

Overall, the evaluation confidence is high due to the inclusion of confidence intervals for performance metrics, strong statistical significance in survival analysis, and consistent results across multiple datasets."	B_Better		2026-02-10T11:07:51.494154

PMC8230313	dataset/provenance	Profiles of 150 metabolites based on gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of plasma samples from 70 postmenopausal women.	"The dataset used in this study was sourced from a prospective observational cohort study involving 70 patients. These patients were categorized into three groups: 23 diagnosed with coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), 21 diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD), and 26 defined as the control group. The study was approved by the Izmir Katip Celebi University Interventional Clinical Studies Institutional Review Board and conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Participants provided consent for the use of their specimens and medical data to determine biomarkers of CMD in postmenopausal women.

The data collection process included detailed anamnesis, physical examinations, body mass index (BMI) measurements, medications, transthoracic echocardiograms, blood pressure measurements, and routine biochemical examinations. These examinations included measurements of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, urea, creatinine, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), hemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell (WBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and platelet (PLT) levels.

Blood samples were obtained from patients who underwent coronary angiography, which was performed using the Judkins technique through the femoral or radial artery. Plasma samples prepared from these blood samples were stored at −80°C for further processing. The study focused on detecting and quantifying circulating metabolites in plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. This analysis was performed at the UIUC Metabolomics Center, following established protocols.

The raw data consisted of 175 metabolites measured across the 70 patients. This dataset was normalized using min/max scaling and underwent data imputation to handle missing values. Metabolic feature columns with more than 40% missing data were eliminated. An iterative imputer was trained to infill missing values, and the performance of the imputer was measured using the R2 metric. Metabolite columns with an R2 score less than 0.3 and more than 5% missing values were excluded. The final dataset, after preprocessing, included 75 metabolites, which were used for further analysis."	B_Better		2026-02-10T11:13:58.647888

PMC8230313	optimization/algorithm	Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) from sklearn. Random forest was used as the estimator.	"The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the random forest classifier. This is a well-established ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.

The random forest algorithm is not new; it has been widely used and studied in the machine-learning community for many years. It is a robust and versatile method that is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and provide good generalization performance.

The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our primary focus was on applying this algorithm to identify biomarkers associated with coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) and coronary artery disease (CAD). The novelty of our work lies in the application of this established machine-learning technique to a specific biomedical problem, rather than in the development of a new algorithm. Our study contributes to the field of metabolomics and cardiovascular research by demonstrating the potential of random forest classifiers in identifying metabolic biomarkers for CMD and CAD. The algorithm was used as part of a broader analytical pipeline that included data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) method was employed to select the most relevant metabolites, and the random forest classifier was then used to build a predictive model based on these selected features. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC) and the F1 score, and the results were visualized using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves."

The raw data consisting of 175 metabolites measured across 70 participants was normalized using min/max scaling.  2) Data imputation with IterativeImputer of sklearn was utilized to handle missing data. The trained imputer was tested by removing the data of one metabolite feature column and imputing the data afterward. The performance of the imputer was measured for each of the metabolites using R^2 metric. Metabolite columns with R^2 < 0.3 and more than 5% of missing values across all patients were removed. 3) Data standardization to zero mean and unit variance for each metabolite feature column.

Initially, the number of features (metabolites) was indeed much larger than the number of training points (patients). To address potential overfitting, several preprocessing and feature selection steps were undertaken.

First, data normalization using min/max scaling was performed, followed by data imputation to handle missing values. Metabolite features with more than 40% missing data were eliminated. An iterative imputer was then trained to infill missing values, and features with an R2 measure less than 0.3 and more than 5% missing values were removed. This preprocessing step reduced the feature columns to 75 metabolites.

Next, feature selection was performed using the recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) algorithm. This iterative process computed the cross-validation score each time a metabolite feature column was eliminated, ensuring that only the most relevant features were retained. The classification performance significantly improved when more than 10 features were selected, with the highest score achieved using 15 metabolites.

To further validate the model and rule out underfitting, a binary classification was implemented using the random forest algorithm. The binary labels were ""CMD"" and ""non-CMD,"" combining both the CAD and control group samples. The training and testing were conducted using 5-fold cross-validation with a fixed random seed. This approach helped in assessing the model's generalizability and ensuring that it was not too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

The performance was measured and visualized using receiver operating curves (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves. The mean area under the curve (AUC) and mean F1 score were computed for different metabolite sets, including stearic acid only, ornithine only, stearic acid and ornithine together, and the 15 metabolites selected by RFECV.

PMC8230313	optimization/regularization	Not specified	"In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting during the machine learning analysis. One of the key methods used was recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV). This technique iteratively removes the least important features and builds a model on those remaining features, using cross-validation to score the model. By doing so, it helps in selecting the most relevant features and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Additionally, we utilized 5-fold cross-validation during the training and testing of our models. This approach ensures that the model is evaluated on different subsets of the data, providing a more robust estimate of its performance and helping to prevent overfitting.

We also performed data normalization and standardization as part of our preprocessing steps. Normalization using min/max scaling and standardization involving mean removal and variance scaling helped in ensuring that all features contributed equally to the model, further mitigating the risk of overfitting.

Moreover, we handled missing data through imputation techniques, which involved using an iterative imputer to fill in missing values. This step is crucial as it ensures that the model is trained on a complete dataset, reducing the likelihood of overfitting due to incomplete data."	B_Better		2026-02-10T11:21:32.336245

Unpaired t-test to identify metabolites with differences between CMD and non-CMD.	"The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It utilizes a random forest algorithm, which is inherently interpretable. Random forests are ensembles of decision trees, and each tree can be visualized to understand the decision-making process. This transparency allows for the identification of the most important features contributing to the classification.

For instance, the recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) algorithm was used to select the most relevant metabolites. This process iteratively computed cross-validation scores while eliminating less important features, ultimately identifying a set of 15 metabolites that provided the highest classification performance. This subset of metabolites can be examined to understand their biological significance and how they contribute to the classification of CMD versus non-CMD.

Additionally, the study identified specific metabolites such as stearic acid and ornithine as significant indicators of CMD. The performance of these metabolites, both individually and in combination, was evaluated using receiver operating curves (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves. This detailed analysis provides clear examples of how the model's decisions can be interpreted and validated.

Furthermore, the use of an unpaired t-test to identify significantly different metabolites between CMD vs. control and CAD vs. control groups adds another layer of interpretability. This statistical method highlights specific metabolites that differ significantly between groups, providing a clear understanding of the biological differences being captured by the model.

In summary, the model's transparency is evident through the use of interpretable algorithms like random forests and statistical methods like t-tests. The identification of key metabolites and their contributions to the classification process allows for a clear understanding of the model's decision-making, making it a valuable tool for biological interpretation."

PMC8230313	evaluation/measure	Receiver operating curves (ROC), precision–recall (PR) curves, AUC score, F1 score	"In the evaluation of our biomarker signature set, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the classification effectiveness. The primary metrics reported are the mean area under the curve (AUC) and the mean F_1 score, both of which are crucial for evaluating the performance of binary classifiers.

The AUC provides a comprehensive measure of the classifier's ability to distinguish between the two classes, ""CMD"" and ""non-CMD"". It ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates better performance. We computed the mean AUC for different sets of metabolites, including stearic acid only, ornithine only, a combination of stearic acid and ornithine, and a set of 15 metabolites selected by the RFECV algorithm. The highest mean AUC was observed for the 15-metabolite set, indicating its superior discriminative power.

The mean F_1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offers a balanced measure of the classifier's accuracy, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. We reported the mean F_1 scores for the same metabolite sets, providing insights into the classifier's precision and recall trade-offs. The mean F_1 scores were relatively consistent across different metabolite sets, with slight variations.

These metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating classification models, particularly in biomedical research. They provide a robust framework for comparing the performance of different biomarker sets and ensuring that the selected features are effective in distinguishing between the target classes. The use of 5-fold cross-validation with a fixed random seed further enhances the reliability of our performance measures, ensuring that the results are not dependent on a particular data split."

These comparisons served as simpler baselines against which we could measure the improvement provided by our selected set of 15 metabolites. The results indicated that the set of 15 metabolites achieved the highest mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.63 and a mean F_1 score of 0.40, outperforming the simpler baselines.

For instance, the mean area under the curve (AUC) and mean F_1 score for different metabolite sets were computed with their respective standard deviations. This approach allows us to assess the variability and consistency of our results.

Statistical significance was a key consideration in our analysis. We used an unpaired t-test to identify metabolites that differed significantly between groups, with p-values indicating the level of significance. For example, stearic acid and ornithine were found to be significantly different indicators of CMD, while valine was statistically different in the CAD group compared to the control group.

In our classification tasks, we employed 5-fold cross-validation to ensure that our results were robust and not due to overfitting.

The mean AUC and F_1 scores, along with their standard deviations, provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance and its statistical significance.

Additionally, we used the recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) algorithm to select the most informative metabolites. This iterative process helped us identify that classification scores improved significantly when more than 10 features were selected, with the highest score achieved using 15 metabolites.
