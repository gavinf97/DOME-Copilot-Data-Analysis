# DOME Copilot Experiment: Metadata, Supplementary Data, and Evaluation Source Files

## Dataset Overview
This dataset supports the research on "DOME Copilot", an AI-assisted workflow for curating machine learning experiment metadata from scientific publications. It aggregates the machine-readable output of the AI models, the ground truth human reviews, and the processed supplementary data files associated with the analyzed publications.

## Archive Content: `DOME_Copilot_Data_Package.zip`

The main data package is organized into the following directories and files:

### 1. Metadata Index
*   **`DOME_Copilot_Data_Package_Metadata.csv`**: A comprehensive index mapping every PMCID (PubMed Central ID) in the dataset to the directories where its data can be found. Use this to quickly locate resources for a specific paper.

### 2. Registry & Ground Truth
*   **`DOME_Registry_Human_Reviews_258_20260205.json`**: The core reference dataset containing expert human-reviewed metadata annotations for the DOME Registry papers.

### 3. Copilot Output (AI Generated)
*   **`Copilot_Processed_Datasets_JSON/`**: 
    *   Contains the structured JSON metadata generated by the DOME Copilot pipeline.
    *   Includes processed versions for the Registry Cohort (222 papers) and the Experimental Cohort (1012 papers).

### 4. Supplementary Data Material
This archive contains the raw supplementary material downloaded from PMC for the study cohorts, which serves as input data for the DOME analysis.
*   **`DOME_Registry_PMC_Supplementary/`**: Supplementary files for the 222 articles in the DOME Registry (Source Truth).
*   **`Positive_PMC_Supplementary/`**: Supplementary files for the 1012 "Positive" articles (Machine Learning relevant - Experimental Cohort).
*   **`Negative_PMC_Supplementary/`**: Supplementary files for the 1012 "Negative" articles (Control set / Non-ML).

### 5. Evaluation Data
*   **`30_Evaluation_Source_JSONs_Human_and_Copilot_Including_PDFs/`**: 
    *   The specific source files used for the deep-dive comparative evaluation (Human vs. AI) on a random subset of 30 papers.
    *   Contains the Copilot JSONs, Human JSONs, and original PDFs used in the evaluation interface.

## Notes
*   **Matching**: The `DOME_Copilot_Data_Package_Metadata.csv` file is the key to linking entries across these folders. Not all papers have supplementary data.
*   **Privacy**: User-specific data (profiles, emails) has been excluded.
*   **PDFs**: Full-text PDFs (outside the evaluation subset) are not included in this bulk archive due to size and copyright considerations, but can be retrieved using the PMCIDs provided in the metadata or the DOI links in the JSONs.
